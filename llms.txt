## Hinge Types

- [Self-Closing Hinges](https://door.watersonusa.com/knowledge/hinge-types/self-closing-hinges/): Hinges with built-in spring or hydraulic mechanisms for automatic door closing. Required for fire-rated doors per NFPA 80.
- [Spring Hinges](https://door.watersonusa.com/knowledge/hinge-types/spring-hinges/): Coiled spring inside barrel for automatic closing. Simple, cost-effective, limited speed control.
- [Butt Hinges](https://door.watersonusa.com/knowledge/hinge-types/butt-hinges/): Most common door hinge type, mortised into door edge and frame.
- [Continuous Hinges](https://door.watersonusa.com/knowledge/hinge-types/continuous-hinges/): Full-length hinges for maximum weight distribution and durability.
- [Pivot Hinges](https://door.watersonusa.com/knowledge/hinge-types/pivot-hinges/): Top/bottom mounted, allows bidirectional swing.
- [Concealed Hinges](https://door.watersonusa.com/knowledge/hinge-types/concealed-hinges/): Hidden when door is closed for clean aesthetics.
- [Swing Clear Hinges](https://door.watersonusa.com/knowledge/hinge-types/swing-clear-hinges/): Offset design maximizes door opening width for ADA accessibility.
- [Hinge Comparison Guide](https://door.watersonusa.com/knowledge/hinge-types/comparison-guide/): Side-by-side comparison of all hinge types.

## Standards & Code Compliance

- [ANSI/BHMA A156.17](https://door.watersonusa.com/knowledge/standards/ansi-bhma-a156-17/): Self-closing hinge standard. Grade 1 = 1,000,000+ cycles, required for fire doors.
- [NFPA 80 Fire Doors](https://door.watersonusa.com/knowledge/standards/nfpa-80-fire-doors/): Hinge material, size, quantity, and self-closing requirements for fire-rated assemblies.
- [ADA Door Requirements](https://door.watersonusa.com/knowledge/standards/ada-door-requirements/): Opening force ≤5 lbf, closing speed ≥1.5 seconds from 70°, clear width.
- [UL Fire-Rated](https://door.watersonusa.com/knowledge/standards/ul-fire-rated/): Testing and listing requirements for fire-rated hinges.
- [ICC A117.1](https://door.watersonusa.com/knowledge/standards/icc-a117-1/): Accessibility standards for door hardware.
- [Grade 1/2/3 Explained](https://door.watersonusa.com/knowledge/standards/grade-classifications/): ANSI/BHMA grade classification system.

## FAQ (Key Questions)

Q: What is a self-closing hinge?
A: A door hinge with a built-in spring, hydraulic, or hybrid mechanism that automatically returns the door to closed position. Used for fire safety (NFPA 80) and convenience.

Q: Are self-closing hinges required on fire doors?
A: Yes. NFPA 80 requires all fire-rated doors to have either a listed door closer or listed ANSI/BHMA A156.17 Grade 1 self-closing hinges. Minimum 2 spring hinges per fire door.

Q: How many hinges does a fire door need?
A: One hinge per 30 inches of door height (NFPA 80). Standard 7-foot door = 3 hinges. Over 8 feet = heavy-weight (0.180" leaf thickness).

Q: Can self-closing hinges meet ADA?
A: Yes. Hydraulic self-closing hinges with adjustable speed can meet both ADA (≥1.5s closing, ≤5 lbf force) and fire code requirements simultaneously.
