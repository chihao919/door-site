<h1>Spring Hinges on Fire Doors &mdash; NFPA 80 Rules, Limitations &amp; Requirements</h1>

<blockquote>
  Spring hinges <em>are</em> permitted on fire-rated doors under NFPA 80 &mdash; but only when they are listed to ANSI/BHMA A156.17 Grade 1, installed in a minimum quantity of two per door leaf, and used on doors that do not exceed the dimensional limits in the product&rsquo;s UL listing (typically 3&prime;0&Prime; wide &times; 7&prime;0&Prime; tall). When these conditions cannot be met, a conventional listed door closer is required. This article covers every NFPA 80 rule, size limit, common inspection failure, and scenario where spring hinges are not allowed.

<h2>Can You Use Spring Hinges on Fire Doors?</h2>
<p>The short answer is <strong>yes, with conditions</strong>. NFPA 80, the authoritative standard governing fire door assemblies in the United States, explicitly recognizes spring hinges (also called self-closing hinges) as an acceptable method of providing the mandatory self-closing function on swinging fire-rated doors. However, NFPA 80 does not give a blanket approval to any spring hinge on any fire door. There are specific material requirements, minimum quantity rules, dimensional size limits, and listing requirements that must all be satisfied simultaneously.</p>
<p>The reason NFPA 80 permits spring hinges at all is practical: for smaller, single-leaf fire doors &mdash; particularly in residential, light commercial, and retrofit applications &mdash; a dedicated door closer can be expensive, visually intrusive, and difficult to install in existing frames. Listed Grade 1 spring hinges provide an integrated self-closing solution that is concealed within the hinge barrel, requires no additional hardware on the door face, and can be a cost-effective, code-compliant alternative to a conventional overhead door closer.</p>
<p>Understanding when spring hinges are permitted, and when they are not, is essential for architects, specifiers, building owners, and door hardware distributors who work with fire-rated openings.</p>

<h2>NFPA 80 Self-Closing Requirement</h2>
<p>Every fire-rated swinging door assembly in the United States must comply with NFPA 80&rsquo;s self-closing mandate. NFPA 80 Section 4.8.3 states that all fire door assemblies shall be provided with a <strong>listed self-closing device</strong>. The purpose of this requirement is straightforward: an open fire door provides no fire protection. The door must return to its closed and latched position automatically, without human intervention, to function as a passive fire barrier.</p>
<p>NFPA 80 identifies two primary self-closing methods for single-leaf swinging fire doors:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Listed door closers</strong> &mdash; overhead surface-mounted, concealed overhead, or floor-mounted hydraulic closers tested and listed for use on fire-rated assemblies</li>
  <li><strong>Listed self-closing hinges</strong> &mdash; spring hinges or hydraulic closer hinges meeting ANSI/BHMA A156.17 Grade 1, in which the closing mechanism is built into the hinge itself</li>
</ul>
<p>When spring hinges are chosen as the self-closing device, NFPA 80 imposes several additional requirements beyond those that apply to standard (non-self-closing) hinges on fire doors. These requirements exist because a spring hinge must carry both the mechanical load of supporting the door weight and the functional load of reliably closing a fire barrier across many thousands of cycles over its service life.</p>

<h2>ANSI/BHMA A156.17 Grade 1 Requirement</h2>
<p>The performance benchmark for spring hinges used on fire-rated doors is <strong>ANSI/BHMA A156.17</strong>, the American National Standard for Self-Closing Hinges and Pivots. NFPA 80 references this standard and requires that self-closing hinges used on fire doors meet <strong>Grade 1</strong> &mdash; the highest performance tier in the ANSI/BHMA grading system.</p>
<p>To achieve Grade 1 certification under ANSI/BHMA A156.17, a spring hinge must pass the following tests:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cycle durability:</strong> 500,000 open-and-close cycles without mechanical failure or loss of closing function. Grade 2 is tested to 250,000 cycles; Grade 3 to 125,000 cycles. Only Grade 1 meets NFPA 80&rsquo;s requirements for fire-rated applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Closing force consistency:</strong> The hinge must consistently return the door to the closed and latched position from any open angle, including from a 1-inch (25 mm) open position, without manual assistance.</li>
  <li><strong>Material integrity:</strong> The hinge body, leaves, and barrel must be constructed of steel or stainless steel and must not deform or fracture during the test cycle program.</li>
  <li><strong>Spring tension retention:</strong> The spring mechanism must retain adequate tension to overcome door seal friction, weatherstripping drag, and slight frame irregularities throughout the rated cycle life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Grade 2 and Grade 3 spring hinges are <strong>not acceptable</strong> on fire-rated doors, regardless of price or appearance. When purchasing spring hinges for a fire door application, always verify that the product carries a current ANSI/BHMA A156.17 Grade 1 certification mark from a recognized testing laboratory such as UL, Intertek (ETL), or DHI&rsquo;s DHHM program.</p>

<div class="success-note">
  Look for the ANSI/BHMA A156.17 Grade 1 certification mark on the hinge packaging and the product listing sheet. If the product documentation only states "Grade 2" or does not reference the Grade, it does not qualify for fire door use under NFPA 80.
</div>

<h2>Minimum Quantity: Why Two Spring Hinges Are Required</h2>
<p>NFPA 80 mandates a <strong>minimum of two listed spring hinges per door leaf</strong> when spring hinges serve as the sole self-closing device on a fire door. This redundancy requirement is a critical safety provision, not an arbitrary rule.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind the two-hinge minimum is straightforward: spring mechanisms can weaken over time as the spring metal fatigues through repeated deflection. If a fire door relies on a single spring hinge and that hinge&rsquo;s spring tension diminishes below the threshold needed to overcome the door&rsquo;s weight, seal friction, and any slight frame misalignment, the door may fail to close fully or fail to latch. With two spring hinges installed, the probability of simultaneous failure in both units is substantially lower, providing a meaningful safety margin during the fire door&rsquo;s operational life between annual inspections.</p>
<p>In practice, the two-spring-hinge rule works in conjunction with the general NFPA 80 hinge quantity rule (one hinge per 30 inches of door height, minimum two). For a standard 6&prime;8&Prime; (80&Prime;) door that requires three hinges total, a common installation strategy is:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Option A:</strong> Top and bottom hinges are spring hinges (Grade 1 listed); center hinge is a plain bearing (non-spring) steel hinge. Both spring hinges provide closing force; the center plain hinge provides additional structural support.</li>
  <li><strong>Option B:</strong> All three hinges are spring hinges. This exceeds the minimum two-spring-hinge requirement and provides maximum spring force, which is useful when door seals create significant drag.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both options are code-compliant as long as all hinges are steel, the spring hinges are ANSI/BHMA A156.17 Grade 1 listed, and the door closes and latches reliably from any open position, including from 1&Prime; open as required by NFPA 80 Section 5.2.1.3.</p>

<div class="warning-note">
  Installing only one spring hinge on a fire door and relying on it as the sole self-closing device is a direct violation of NFPA 80. This is one of the most frequently cited deficiencies in annual fire door inspections.
</div>

<h2>Maximum Door Size Limitations</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most important &mdash; and most frequently overlooked &mdash; limitation on spring hinges for fire doors is the <strong>maximum door size</strong>. Unlike a door closer, which can be selected in a range of power sizes (closer sizes 1 through 6) to match almost any door width, spring hinges have a finite amount of spring energy available in their barrel. As door width increases, the moment arm (the torque the door&rsquo;s weight creates around the hinge line) grows substantially, and the spring mechanism must overcome this increasing torque to close the door.</p>
<p>Most UL-listed Grade 1 spring hinges carry dimensional limits in their product listing that specify the maximum door size for which the listing is valid. These limits are not suggestions &mdash; they are part of the listed assembly. Using a spring hinge on a door that exceeds the listing limits renders the spring hinge non-compliant, even if the hinge physically fits the door.</p>
<p>Typical maximum dimensions for UL-listed Grade 1 spring hinges:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Dimension</th>
      <th>Typical Limit</th>
      <th>Extended Limit (select products)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Maximum door width</td>
      <td>3&prime;0&Prime; (36&Prime;)</td>
      <td>3&prime;0&Prime; (very few products extend beyond this)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Maximum door height</td>
      <td>7&prime;0&Prime; (84&Prime;)</td>
      <td>8&prime;0&Prime; (96&Prime;) for some listed products</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Maximum door weight</td>
      <td>Varies by product; typically 50&ndash;75 lb</td>
      <td>Up to 100 lb for heavy-duty listed models</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Maximum door thickness</td>
      <td>1-3/4&Prime; (standard fire door thickness)</td>
      <td>2&Prime; for some commercial-grade listed products</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>For fire doors wider than 3&prime;0&Prime; (36&Prime;), spring hinges are almost universally disqualified by their listing requirements, and a <strong>conventional overhead door closer is required</strong>. This applies to 3&prime;4&Prime;, 3&prime;6&Prime;, 3&prime;8&Prime;, and 4&prime;0&Prime; doors, which are extremely common in commercial and institutional construction. Specifiers working with these wider fire doors must use a listed hydraulic door closer, not spring hinges.</p>
<p>Always consult the specific product&rsquo;s current UL listing page or product data sheet to confirm the maximum dimensions before specifying spring hinges on any fire door. Listing limits can change between product revisions, and not all Grade 1 spring hinges carry identical listing scopes.</p>

<h2>UL Listing and Labeled Assembly Requirements</h2>
<p>NFPA 80 requires that fire door assemblies be <strong>listed and labeled</strong> by a recognized testing laboratory. This listing requirement extends to the hardware components, including self-closing devices. When spring hinges are used as the self-closing mechanism on a fire door, they must carry a current UL listing (or listing from an equivalent OSHA-recognized Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory, or NRTL).</p>
<p>The UL listing for spring hinges used on fire doors encompasses several elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Component listing:</strong> The hinge itself is listed as a component suitable for use in fire door assemblies. Look for the UL Mark or UL classification mark on the product or packaging.</li>
  <li><strong>Assembly listing:</strong> The complete fire door assembly &mdash; door, frame, hinges, lockset, and any seals &mdash; must be listed as a system. The door manufacturer&rsquo;s listing documentation will specify which hardware components are compatible with the listed assembly.</li>
  <li><strong>Field labeling:</strong> When a non-listed hinge is substituted into an otherwise listed assembly, the assembly loses its listing. If a door manufacturer&rsquo;s instructions specify a particular spring hinge model, that model (or an approved equivalent) must be used.</li>
</ul>
<p>The label on the fire door itself (typically the UL label affixed to the hinge stile on the door edge) identifies the fire rating of the door leaf. The frame typically carries a separate UL label. The hardware &mdash; including hinges and closer &mdash; must be separately listed. An inspector finding non-listed spring hinges on a fire door during an annual NFPA 80 inspection will cite this as a deficiency requiring immediate correction.</p>

<h2>When Spring Hinges Are NOT Allowed on Fire Doors</h2>
<p>While spring hinges are a legitimate option for many fire door installations, there are scenarios where they are explicitly prohibited or practically disqualified:</p>

<h3>1. Door Exceeds Maximum Listed Size</h3>
<p>As discussed above, doors wider than 3&prime;0&Prime; or taller than the listed maximum for the specific spring hinge product cannot legally use spring hinges as the self-closing device. A conventional door closer is required for all oversized fire doors.</p>

<h3>2. Pairs of Fire Doors</h3>
<p>Pairs of fire doors &mdash; double-leaf openings where both doors are fire-rated &mdash; present a coordination challenge that spring hinges cannot address. NFPA 80 requires that on a pair of fire doors, the <strong>inactive leaf must close before the active leaf</strong>, so that the astragal (the overlapping edge molding) does not prevent the active leaf from latching. This sequencing is managed by a door <strong>coordinator</strong>, which is a mechanical device mounted at the top of the frame that holds the active leaf open until the inactive leaf fully closes.</p>
<p>Coordinators are designed to work with overhead door closers, not spring hinges. Furthermore, spring hinges on the inactive leaf of a pair would be prevented from closing by the coordinator mechanism until released, which can create timing conflicts and functional failures. For these reasons, spring hinges are <strong>generally not used on pairs of fire doors</strong>; overhead door closers on both leaves, combined with a coordinator and flush bolts (automatic-acting type) on the inactive leaf, are the standard approach.</p>

<h3>3. Electromagnetic Hold-Open Applications</h3>
<p>NFPA 80 permits fire doors to be held open with electromagnetic hold-open devices that release automatically when the building fire alarm activates. These hold-open systems are commonly used in hospital corridors, school hallways, and other high-traffic fire-rated openings where keeping the door open during normal occupancy improves convenience and accessibility.</p>
<p>Electromagnetic hold-opens are designed to interface with overhead door closers &mdash; the hold-open arm attaches to the closer arm and holds the door against the closer spring force. Spring hinges have no compatible interface for electromagnetic hold-open devices. A spring hinge cannot be overridden by an electromagnetic hold-open; the spring tension would continuously attempt to pull the door shut rather than allowing it to be held open.</p>
<p>For any fire door that requires hold-open functionality, an <strong>overhead door closer with an electromagnetic hold-open arm</strong> is required. Spring hinges are not an option in these applications.</p>

<h3>4. High-Traffic or High-Abuse Locations</h3>
<p>While not a strict NFPA 80 prohibition, spring hinge spring mechanisms are subject to wear that can be accelerated by high traffic volume or door abuse (slamming, impact from carts, etc.). In high-cycle environments such as hospital emergency departments, school cafeteria corridors, or warehouse fire doors receiving hundreds of cycles per day, the spring fatigue rate can significantly exceed the expected service life. Many specifiers and AHJs prefer conventional door closers &mdash; which offer adjustable closing speed, backcheck, and delayed action &mdash; in high-traffic fire door locations, even when spring hinges would technically be permitted by the listing dimensions.</p>

<h3>5. AHJ-Specific Requirements</h3>
<p>The Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) &mdash; typically the local fire marshal or building official &mdash; has the authority to impose requirements more stringent than those in NFPA 80. Some AHJs in certain jurisdictions or for certain occupancy classifications require overhead door closers on all fire-rated doors, regardless of size. Before specifying spring hinges on a fire door, confirm with the local AHJ that spring hinges are acceptable for the specific application and occupancy type.</p>

<div class="warning-note">
  Always verify with the local AHJ before finalizing a spring hinge specification for a fire door. Some jurisdictions require overhead door closers on all fire-rated openings, particularly in healthcare (Group I) and educational (Group E) occupancies.
</div>

<h3>6. Door Manufacturer&rsquo;s Listing Restrictions</h3>
<p>Individual fire door manufacturer listings may specify that certain door models must be used with a particular type of closer. If the door manufacturer&rsquo;s listing documentation &mdash; not just NFPA 80 &mdash; requires a conventional door closer, then substituting spring hinges voids the door&rsquo;s listing. Always cross-reference the door leaf listing requirements with the hardware specification.</p>

<h2>Spring Hinges vs. Door Closers on Fire Doors</h2>
<p>The decision between spring hinges and conventional overhead door closers for a fire door is a common specification challenge. Each approach has distinct advantages and disadvantages that must be weighed against the project requirements:</p>

<h2>Spring Hinge Tension Adjustment on Fire Doors</h2>
<p>One practical aspect of spring hinges that affects their performance on fire doors is spring tension adjustment. Most Grade 1 spring hinges incorporate a tension adjustment mechanism &mdash; typically a set of adjustment holes in the hinge barrel that allow the installer to set the spring to one of several preset tension levels. Proper tension setting is critical for NFPA 80 compliance:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Too little tension:</strong> The door may not fully close and latch, especially against weatherstripping or door seals. This is a direct NFPA 80 violation and one of the most common inspection failures.</li>
  <li><strong>Too much tension:</strong> The door may slam shut violently, creating a safety hazard and potentially damaging the door, frame, or latch hardware. Excessive closing force may also prevent ADA compliance (opening force above 5 lbf for interior fire doors per ANSI A117.1).</li>
</ul>
<p>The correct procedure is to set the minimum tension that reliably closes and latches the door from any open position, including from a 1&Prime; crack (as required by NFPA 80 Section 5.2.1.3), without slamming. If the door cannot be made to close reliably at any allowable tension setting, the door likely exceeds the spring hinge&rsquo;s listing limits, or the spring mechanism has fatigued and the hinge must be replaced.</p>

<h2>Common Spring Hinge Inspection Failures on Fire Doors</h2>
<p>Annual NFPA 80 inspections frequently uncover deficiencies related to spring hinges on fire-rated doors. Understanding these failure modes helps building owners and fire door inspectors identify and correct issues before they become code violations:</p>

<h3>Failure 1: Only One Spring Hinge Installed</h3>
<p>The single most common spring hinge deficiency is finding only one spring hinge on a fire door &mdash; typically the top hinge &mdash; with plain bearing hinges at the other positions. This directly violates NFPA 80&rsquo;s two-spring-hinge minimum. The correction is to replace at least one additional hinge with a listed Grade 1 spring hinge.</p>

<h3>Failure 2: Non-Listed or Residential-Grade Spring Hinges</h3>
<p>Residential spring hinges and Grade 2 or Grade 3 ANSI/BHMA products are widely available at hardware stores and are frequently used by maintenance staff who are unfamiliar with fire door requirements. These products are not listed for fire door use and must be replaced with listed Grade 1 products. Residential spring hinges typically have no ANSI/BHMA grade markings; always look for the Grade 1 designation and the UL or NRTL listing mark.</p>

<h3>Failure 3: Inadequate Spring Tension &mdash; Door Fails to Close and Latch</h3>
<p>Spring tension decreases over time as the spring metal fatigues. A spring hinge that was correctly adjusted at installation may lose enough tension over several years to no longer reliably close the door against its seal. The inspector will test this by opening the door fully and observing whether it closes and latches completely on its own. If the door stops short of latching, the spring tension must be increased or the hinge replaced.</p>

<h3>Failure 4: Door Exceeds Listing Limits but Spring Hinges Are Used</h3>
<p>When a 3&prime;4&Prime; or 3&prime;6&Prime; fire door has spring hinges installed &mdash; perhaps because they were originally specified for a 3&prime;0&Prime; door before the opening was widened &mdash; the spring hinges exceed their listing scope. This is a non-obvious deficiency that requires knowledge of the product listing. The correction is to replace the spring hinges with a listed overhead door closer sized for the door width.</p>

<h3>Failure 5: Corrosion or Physical Damage to Spring Hinge</h3>
<p>Spring hinges in exterior-adjacent locations or high-humidity environments can develop corrosion that compromises the spring mechanism. Visible rust, deformation of the hinge leaves, or binding of the hinge barrel are all deficiencies requiring replacement. Even stainless steel spring hinges can fail if damaged by impact from a door stop or misaligned door.</p>

<h3>Failure 6: Mixed Hinge Types Within Non-Listed Combination</h3>
<p>Some fire door assemblies have manufacturer-specific requirements specifying that all hinges must be from the same product family, or that specific hinge models must be used. Mixing listed and non-listed hinges, or mixing hinges from different manufacturers in a way not addressed by the assembly listing, may constitute a non-conforming installation. Inspectors familiar with specific door manufacturer listing requirements may flag this deficiency.</p>

<h2>AHJ Considerations and Field Variances</h2>
<p>NFPA 80 establishes the national baseline standard for fire door assemblies, but it is the <strong>Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)</strong> &mdash; the local fire marshal, building official, or state fire safety authority &mdash; who has the final say on what is acceptable in a specific project or jurisdiction. This distinction matters for spring hinges in several ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some AHJs in states with more prescriptive fire codes (such as California, New York, and Florida) may require overhead door closers on all fire-rated openings regardless of NFPA 80&rsquo;s permission to use spring hinges. Verify local amendments to NFPA 80 before specifying.</li>
  <li>For existing buildings, AHJs may grant variances or equivalencies that allow spring hinges where a closer might otherwise be required, provided the building owner can demonstrate that the spring hinges reliably close and latch the door.</li>
  <li>Healthcare facilities (Joint Commission-accredited hospitals and nursing homes) are subject to the Life Safety Code (NFPA 101), which adopts NFPA 80 by reference but may have additional interpretations enforced by Joint Commission surveyors. In practice, many Joint Commission surveys flag spring hinges on fire doors, particularly if only one spring hinge is present, even in facilities where the local AHJ has not raised objections.</li>
  <li>Always document the AHJ&rsquo;s position on spring hinges in writing before finalizing the specification. This protects the design team and building owner if inspection challenges arise after construction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="faq-item">
  <strong>Q: Can you use spring hinges on fire doors?</strong>
  <p>Yes, spring hinges are permitted on fire-rated doors under NFPA 80, provided they are listed to ANSI/BHMA A156.17 Grade 1, made of steel or stainless steel, and installed in a minimum quantity of two per door leaf. The door must also not exceed the maximum size in the product&rsquo;s UL listing &mdash; typically 3&prime;0&Prime; wide by 7&prime;0&Prime; tall. For doors larger than 3&prime;0&Prime; wide, a conventional listed door closer is generally required.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <strong>Q: How many spring hinges are required on a fire door?</strong>
  <p>NFPA 80 requires a <strong>minimum of two listed spring hinges</strong> when spring hinges serve as the sole self-closing device on a fire door leaf. This is separate from &mdash; and in addition to &mdash; the general hinge quantity rule (one hinge per 30 inches of door height). A standard 6&prime;8&Prime; fire door requiring three hinges might use two spring hinges and one plain bearing hinge, or all three may be spring hinges. Both configurations are acceptable as long as at least two are spring hinges.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <strong>Q: What is the maximum door size allowed with spring hinges on a fire door?</strong>
  <p>Most spring hinge UL listings limit use to doors no wider than <strong>3&prime;0&Prime; (36 inches)</strong> and no taller than <strong>7&prime;0&Prime; (84 inches)</strong>. Some Grade 1 listed products extend the height limit to 8&prime;0&Prime; (96 inches). For doors wider than 3&prime;0&Prime;, a conventional overhead door closer is required. Always verify the specific product&rsquo;s UL listing data sheet for exact dimensional limits, as limits vary by product and manufacturer.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <strong>Q: What ANSI/BHMA standard governs spring hinges on fire doors?</strong>
  <p><strong>ANSI/BHMA A156.17</strong> (Standard for Self-Closing Hinges and Pivots) is the performance standard referenced by NFPA 80 for spring hinges on fire-rated doors. Grade 1 is the minimum acceptable grade for fire door applications. Grade 1 requires 500,000 open-close cycles without failure &mdash; twice the durability of Grade 2 (250,000 cycles) and four times that of Grade 3 (125,000 cycles). Only Grade 1 complies with NFPA 80.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <strong>Q: When are spring hinges NOT allowed on fire doors?</strong>
  <p>Spring hinges are not permitted when: (1) the door exceeds the maximum size in the product&rsquo;s UL listing (typically 3&prime;0&Prime; wide); (2) the door is part of a pair of fire doors requiring a coordinator; (3) the door requires hold-open functionality connected to the fire alarm system; (4) the AHJ specifically requires overhead door closers for the occupancy type; or (5) the door manufacturer&rsquo;s own listing requires a door closer rather than spring hinges.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <strong>Q: Do spring hinges on fire doors need to be UL listed?</strong>
  <p>Yes. Spring hinges used as the self-closing device on a fire-rated door assembly must be listed by a recognized NRTL such as UL (Underwriters Laboratories) and certified to ANSI/BHMA A156.17 Grade 1. The UL listing confirms that the hinge has been independently tested to reliably close a fire door across its rated cycle life. Unlisted spring hinges &mdash; regardless of their physical appearance or country of origin &mdash; are not acceptable under NFPA 80 for fire door self-closing applications.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <strong>Q: What are the most common spring hinge inspection failures on fire doors?</strong>
  <p>The most frequently cited spring hinge deficiencies during NFPA 80 annual inspections are: (1) <strong>only one spring hinge installed</strong> instead of the required minimum of two; (2) <strong>non-listed or residential-grade spring hinges</strong> that are not ANSI/BHMA A156.17 Grade 1; (3) <strong>insufficient spring tension</strong> that fails to close and latch the door from all open positions; (4) <strong>spring hinges used on oversized doors</strong> beyond the listing limits; and (5) <strong>corroded or damaged spring mechanisms</strong> that no longer provide reliable closing force.</p>
