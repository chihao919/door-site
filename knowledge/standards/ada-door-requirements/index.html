<h1>ADA Door Accessibility Requirements &mdash; Complete Compliance Guide</h1>

<blockquote>
  The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and ICC A117.1 set specific requirements for door hardware to ensure accessibility. Key requirements include: maximum 5 lbf (22 N) opening force for interior doors, minimum 32&rdquo; clear width, closing speed of at least 1.5 seconds from 70&deg; to the latch, and door handles operable without grasping or twisting. Self-closing hinges with hydraulic speed control can meet both ADA and fire code requirements simultaneously.

<h2>ADA Door Opening Force Requirements</h2>

<p>ADA Standards for Accessible Design Section 404.2.9 specifies the maximum force required to operate manual doors on accessible routes. These thresholds ensure that people with limited strength or mobility can open doors independently.</p>

<h3>Opening Force Limits by Door Type</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Interior hinged doors:</strong> &le; 5 lbf (22 N) — the most commonly cited ADA force limit</li>
  <li><strong>Sliding and folding doors:</strong> &le; 5 lbf (22 N) to activate the opening mechanism</li>
  <li><strong>Fire doors:</strong> Exempt from the 5 lbf limit due to self-closing spring requirements, but the ADA recommends minimizing opening force to the extent practicable</li>
  <li><strong>Exterior doors:</strong> Not directly addressed by ADA; opening force limits are set by local jurisdiction codes</li>
</ul>

<p>The 5 lbf threshold applies to the force required to operate the door latch and to push or pull the door open, measured at the latch edge of the door at a height between 34&rdquo; and 48&rdquo; above finish floor (AFF).</p>

<h3>Measuring Opening Force Correctly</h3>
<p>Opening force is measured using a calibrated push/pull force gauge at the latch side of the door, applied at a point between 34&rdquo; and 48&rdquo; AFF. The measurement should capture the peak force required to initiate door movement from the fully latched position. Forces due to door closer spring tension and friction both contribute to the total measured value.</p>

<h2>Door Closing Speed Requirements</h2>

<p>Self-closing doors on accessible routes must close at a controlled speed that gives users sufficient time to pass through. Both ADA and ICC A117.1 address this, with slightly different measurement methods.</p>

<h3>ADA Closing Speed (Section 404.2.8)</h3>
<p>The ADA Standards for Accessible Design require that if a door has a closer, it must take at least <strong>1.5 seconds</strong> to move from the 70-degree open position to the fully closed (latched) position. This is the minimum sweep time that allows wheelchair users and others with limited mobility to clear the door before it closes.</p>

<h3>ICC A117.1 Closing Speed (Section 404.2.8.1)</h3>
<p>The ICC A117.1 (2017 edition) standard, adopted by reference in the International Building Code, provides more specific and in some respects stricter closing speed guidance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>From <strong>90&deg; open to 12&deg; open</strong>: minimum <strong>5 seconds</strong></li>
  <li>This longer sweep window better accounts for the full travel distance a person must navigate while passing through</li>
  <li>The 12-degree endpoint ensures the door does not close aggressively in the final few inches where it could contact a person still in the doorway</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Hydraulic Self-Closing Hinges Meet Closing Speed Requirements</h3>
<p>Hydraulic closer hinges incorporate an oil-filled damping cylinder within the hinge barrel. The flow rate of hydraulic fluid through the valve controls closing speed. Most quality closer hinges provide two independently adjustable valves:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Main sweep valve:</strong> Controls closing speed from full open to approximately 15&deg; — this is the adjustment used to meet ADA and ICC A117.1 timing requirements</li>
  <li><strong>Latch speed valve:</strong> Controls the final closing speed from approximately 15&deg; to fully latched — set faster to ensure positive latching, but not so fast as to slam</li>
</ul>
<p>To comply, set the main sweep valve so a door at 70&deg; takes at least 1.5 seconds (ADA) or 5 seconds from 90&deg; to 12&deg; (ICC A117.1) to close. Verify with a stopwatch after adjustment.</p>

<h3>Adjustment Procedure</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Open the door to 90 degrees and release</li>
  <li>Time the sweep from 90&deg; to 12&deg; using a stopwatch — target 5 seconds or more (ICC A117.1)</li>
  <li>If too fast, turn the main sweep valve clockwise (typically) to reduce hydraulic flow and slow the sweep</li>
  <li>If too slow, turn counterclockwise to increase flow</li>
  <li>Verify the door still latches reliably by testing 10 consecutive closes</li>
  <li>Re-verify timing after any spring tension adjustments, as tension affects effective closing speed</li>
</ol>

<h2>Clear Width Requirements</h2>

<p>ADA Section 404.2.3 requires that doors on accessible routes provide a minimum clear opening width to accommodate wheelchairs and other mobility aids.</p>

<h3>Minimum Clear Width</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>32 inches (815 mm)</strong> minimum clear width when the door is open 90 degrees</li>
  <li>Clear width is measured from the face of the door (at 90&deg;) to the opposite door stop</li>
  <li>A 36-inch nominal door width typically provides approximately 33&frac12;&rdquo; of clear width with a standard hinge, meeting ADA requirements</li>
  <li>Deeper door hardware (hinges, closers mounted on the door face) can reduce effective clear width and must be accounted for</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Swing Clear Hinges Add Clear Width</h3>
<p>Standard butt hinges cause the door to swing partially into its own opening, reducing clear width. <a href="/knowledge/hinge-types/swing-clear-hinges/">Swing clear hinges</a> use an offset knuckle geometry that moves the door completely clear of the frame when open 90 degrees, adding approximately 1&frac12;&rdquo; to 2&rdquo; of usable clear width. This allows a narrower nominal door to achieve the required 32&rdquo; clear, or provides additional clearance margin on standard-width doors.</p>

<h2>Door Hardware Requirements</h2>

<p>ADA Section 404.2.7 (Hardware) requires that door hardware on accessible routes be operable with one hand and not require tight grasping, pinching, or twisting of the wrist.</p>

<h3>Compliant Hardware Types</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lever handles:</strong> The most common ADA-compliant option; operable by pressing down with the forearm or elbow</li>
  <li><strong>Push/pull hardware:</strong> Simple push plates and pull bars that require no grasping</li>
  <li><strong>Loop pulls:</strong> U-shaped pulls that can be operated with a hooked wrist motion</li>
  <li><strong>Paddle or bar handles:</strong> Large-surface hardware operable without finger grip</li>
</ul>

<h3>Non-Compliant Hardware</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Round doorknobs:</strong> Require wrist rotation — not compliant</li>
  <li><strong>Thumb-turn latches without lever backup:</strong> May require pinching — verify operability</li>
  <li><strong>Knob-style deadbolts:</strong> Not compliant on accessible routes without lever alternative</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mounting Height</h3>
<p>All operable hardware on accessible doors must be mounted between <strong>34 inches and 48 inches AFF</strong>. This range is accessible from both a standing and seated (wheelchair) position. Latches, locks, and handles must all fall within this zone.</p>

<h2>How Self-Closing Hinges Meet ADA Requirements</h2>

<p>Self-closing hinges with hydraulic speed control are uniquely suited to meet ADA accessibility requirements while simultaneously satisfying fire code self-closing mandates (NFPA 80). Here is how each ADA requirement is addressed:</p>

<h3>Opening Force &mdash; Adjustable Spring Tension</h3>
<p>Hydraulic closer hinges use a coil spring to provide self-closing force. Unlike surface-mounted door closers that add arm and track resistance on top of spring tension, closer hinges have no external linkage — the spring acts directly on the hinge pin. Spring tension can be adjusted (typically with an Allen wrench at the spring adjustment collar) to the minimum force needed for reliable self-closing. On interior non-fire doors, this can be set below 5 lbf to achieve ADA compliance.</p>

<h3>Closing Speed &mdash; Hydraulic Damping</h3>
<p>The hydraulic cylinder inside the hinge barrel provides independent control of closing sweep speed, separate from spring tension. This means the spring can be set tight enough to ensure reliable latching on a fire door, while the hydraulic damping is simultaneously slowing the sweep speed to meet ADA timing requirements. This dual adjustment capability is the key advantage over simple spring hinges, which cannot independently control speed.</p>

<h3>Waterson Self-Closing Hinges: ADA and NFPA 80 Simultaneously</h3>
<p>Waterson hydraulic self-closing hinges are <a href="/knowledge/standards/ansi-bhma-a156-17/">ANSI/BHMA A156.17</a> Grade 1 rated and UL-listed for 3-hour fire-rated door assemblies. Both the spring tension (opening force) and hydraulic sweep speed (closing speed) are field-adjustable with standard tools. This allows a single hinge product to be set to meet:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ADA Section 404.2.8: &ge; 1.5 seconds from 70&deg; to close</li>
  <li>ICC A117.1 Section 404.2.8.1: &ge; 5 seconds from 90&deg; to 12&deg;</li>
  <li>NFPA 80: reliable self-closing and positive latching for fire door compliance</li>
  <li>ADA Section 404.2.9: &le; 5 lbf opening force (interior non-fire doors)</li>
</ul>

<h2>ADA Self-Closing Hinge Comparison</h2>

  <tr>
    <th>vs</th>
    <th>ADA-Compliant Self-Closing Hinge Advantage</th>
  </tr>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p><strong>Q: What is the maximum door opening force allowed by ADA?</strong></p>
<p>The ADA requires a maximum opening force of <strong>5 lbf (22 N)</strong> for interior hinged doors and sliding or folding doors. Fire doors are exempt from this limit. Exterior doors are not specified in ADA (local codes govern). Opening force is measured at the latch side of the door between 34&rdquo; and 48&rdquo; AFF.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Does ADA apply to fire doors?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, ADA applies to fire doors for most requirements including 32&rdquo; clear width and lever hardware. However, ADA explicitly <strong>exempts fire doors from the 5 lbf opening force limit</strong>, recognizing that fire-rated doors require spring tension sufficient to ensure positive latching and self-closing per NFPA 80. Fire door opening force should still be minimized to the extent consistent with reliable self-closing.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What is the required door closing speed for ADA?</strong></p>
<p>ADA Section 404.2.8 requires self-closing doors to take <strong>at least 1.5 seconds</strong> to move from 70 degrees open to fully closed. ICC A117.1 (2017+) is more specific: from <strong>90 degrees to 12 degrees must take at least 5 seconds</strong>. Both requirements can be met simultaneously using a hydraulic self-closing hinge with an adjustable sweep valve.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Are round doorknobs ADA compliant?</strong></p>
<p>No. Round doorknobs require wrist rotation to operate and are <strong>not ADA compliant</strong> per Section 404.2.7. All door hardware on accessible routes must be operable with one hand without tight grasping, pinching, or twisting. Lever handles, push plates, and loop pulls are all acceptable alternatives.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How do self-closing hinges help meet ADA requirements?</strong></p>
<p>Hydraulic self-closing hinges address ADA compliance in two ways: (1) <strong>Closing speed</strong> — the hydraulic damping mechanism is independently adjustable to ensure the door sweeps slowly enough to meet ADA timing requirements; (2) <strong>Opening force</strong> — spring tension can be adjusted to the lowest effective setting. Unlike surface-mounted closers, there is no arm/track friction adding to opening resistance, making it easier to achieve &le; 5 lbf on interior doors.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What is the difference between ADA and ICC A117.1?</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>ADA</strong> is a federal civil rights law enforced by the Department of Justice. It applies to places of public accommodation and commercial facilities and sets baseline accessibility requirements. <strong>ICC A117.1</strong> is a technical standard published by the International Code Council, incorporated by reference into the International Building Code (IBC). ICC A117.1 is more technically detailed and in some areas sets stricter requirements (such as the 5-second/90&deg;-to-12&deg; closing speed specification). Designers should comply with both; the more stringent requirement applies when they differ.</p>
