<h1>ANSI/BHMA A156.17 — Self-Closing Hinges &amp; Pivots Standard Explained</h1>

<blockquote>
  ANSI/BHMA A156.17 is the American National Standard for self-closing hinges and pivots. It defines performance grades (Grade 1, 2, 3), cycle testing requirements, closing force specifications, and operational criteria. Grade 1 certification (1,000,000+ cycles) is required for self-closing hinges used on fire-rated doors per NFPA 80. This standard is maintained by BHMA (Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association).

<h2>What is ANSI/BHMA A156.17?</h2>

<p>ANSI/BHMA A156.17 is the nationally recognized performance standard that defines how self-closing hinges and pivots must be tested, rated, and classified in the United States. It was developed by BHMA — the Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association — and accredited by ANSI (American National Standards Institute), giving it the authority of a true American National Standard.</p>

<p>The standard covers any hinge or pivot with a built-in mechanism that automatically returns a door to its closed position. This includes spring hinges, hydraulic closer hinges, and combination spring-hydraulic hinges. It does not cover standard non-closing butt hinges (those fall under A156.1) or continuous hinges (A156.26).</p>

<p><strong>Who needs to know about A156.17?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Architects and specifiers</strong> — must reference the correct grade in project specifications, especially for fire-rated openings</li>
  <li><strong>Building inspectors and AHJs (Authorities Having Jurisdiction)</strong> — verify that installed hardware meets the specified grade and is listed where required</li>
  <li><strong>General contractors and hardware distributors</strong> — must source and install compliant products, particularly on fire-rated door assemblies</li>
  <li><strong>Facility managers</strong> — responsible for maintaining compliant hardware over the life of the building</li>
  <li><strong>Manufacturers</strong> — must test and certify products to the standard before making grade claims</li>
</ul>

<p>Without a standard like A156.17, there would be no objective way to compare self-closing hinges from different manufacturers or to verify that a hinge will survive the demands of its intended environment.</p>

<h2>Grade Classification System</h2>

<p>A156.17 uses a three-tier grade system to classify self-closing hinges by durability. Each grade requires products to pass cycle endurance testing — a machine-driven open-and-close test performed at a controlled, consistent pace. One cycle equals one complete opening and one complete closing of the hinge.</p>

<table class="data-table">
  <tr>
    <th>Grade</th>
    <th>Cycle Rating</th>
    <th>Typical Application</th>
    <th>Fire Door Use</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Grade 1</td>
    <td>1,000,000+ cycles</td>
    <td>High-traffic commercial, fire doors, hospitals, schools</td>
    <td>Required</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Grade 2</td>
    <td>500,000+ cycles</td>
    <td>Medium commercial, offices, light institutional</td>
    <td>Not permitted</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Grade 3</td>
    <td>250,000+ cycles</td>
    <td>Residential, light commercial, low-traffic</td>
    <td>Not permitted</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><strong>What does cycle testing mean in practice?</strong> At 1,000,000 cycles, a Grade 1 hinge has been tested to simulate over 27 years of use at 100 cycles per day. The hinge must complete all required cycles without losing its self-closing function, exhibiting excessive wear, or failing structurally. After testing, the hinge is re-evaluated for operational performance to confirm it still meets closing force and speed criteria.</p>

<p>Grade 1 is the only grade approved for use on fire-rated doors. NFPA 80 explicitly requires that self-closing hinges on fire doors be Grade 1 listed devices. Grades 2 and 3 are not permitted on fire-rated openings, regardless of how well-made or appropriately sized they appear.</p>

<h2>Testing Requirements</h2>

<p>A156.17 defines a comprehensive battery of tests that self-closing hinges must pass to achieve each grade. These tests are conducted by accredited third-party test laboratories and are not self-certified by manufacturers.</p>

<h3>Cycle Endurance Testing</h3>
<p>The primary performance test. The hinge is mounted in a test fixture and cycled continuously — fully opened and fully closed — for the number of cycles required by the claimed grade (250,000 / 500,000 / 1,000,000). Testing is conducted at a consistent rate that simulates real-world use without artificially accelerating wear. The hinge must maintain self-closing function throughout.</p>

<h3>Closing Force Testing</h3>
<p>Measures the torque generated by the hinge's closing mechanism across the full range of door travel. This verifies that the hinge produces sufficient closing force to consistently latch the door against realistic door-seal resistance, while not generating excessive force that would violate ADA opening force limits.</p>

<h3>Operational Testing</h3>
<p>Evaluates the hinge as a functioning door device:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Opening force</strong> — the force required to open the door against the self-closing mechanism, measured at the door edge</li>
  <li><strong>Closing speed</strong> — the time from 70 degrees open to fully closed, which must comply with ADA/ICC A117.1 minimums (at least 1.5 seconds) when adjusted to the slowest closing speed setting</li>
  <li><strong>Backcheck</strong> (where applicable) — resistance to sudden opening that could damage the door or hinge</li>
</ul>

<h3>Salt Spray Testing</h3>
<p>For hinges with corrosion resistance claims (stainless steel, coated finishes), A156.17 references ASTM B117 salt spray exposure testing. This verifies that protective finishes and base materials can withstand outdoor or high-humidity environments without degradation of function.</p>

<h3>Static Load Testing</h3>
<p>Verifies that the hinge can carry the static weight of the door without permanent deformation. This is especially important for larger-format hinges on heavy commercial doors, where the hinge must support door weight while simultaneously maintaining its self-closing function.</p>

<h2>How A156.17 Relates to Other Standards</h2>

<h3>NFPA 80 — Fire Door Assemblies</h3>
<p>NFPA 80 is the national standard for fire door assemblies in the United States. It directly references A156.17 by requiring that any self-closing hinge used on a fire-rated door must be Grade 1 listed. This is a hard requirement — not a recommendation. A156.17 Grade 1 certification is the mechanism by which NFPA 80's self-closing requirement is implemented for hinges. When a hinge is specified or installed on a fire door, inspectors verify the Grade 1 listing as part of the AHJ inspection process.</p>

<h3>ADA / ICC A117.1 — Accessible Design</h3>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act and its technical standard, ICC A117.1, limit door closing speed to a minimum of 1.5 seconds from 70 degrees to fully closed, and cap opening force at 5 lbf for interior doors. These accessibility requirements directly interact with A156.17: a hinge must be adjustable enough that its slowest closing speed setting complies with ADA timing, while its closing force must not push the opening force above the ADA limit. Hydraulic self-closing hinges designed to meet both standards allow field adjustment of closing speed to satisfy both fire code and accessibility requirements simultaneously.</p>

<h3>UL — Fire-Rated Hinge Listings</h3>
<p>For hinges installed on fire-rated door assemblies, UL listing is typically required in addition to A156.17 Grade 1 certification. UL evaluates whether the hinge materials and construction will survive the thermal and mechanical stresses of a fire event. A hinge may be A156.17 Grade 1 certified for cycle durability but still require a separate UL listing to be installed on a fire-rated opening. The two certifications address different performance aspects: A156.17 covers operational durability, while UL covers fire survival.</p>

<h3>A156.1 — Standard Butts and Hinges</h3>
<p>ANSI/BHMA A156.1 covers conventional, non-self-closing butt hinges and similar products. It uses its own grade system (Grade 1, 2, 3) based on load capacity and cycle testing, but the grades are not interchangeable with A156.17 grades. A hinge cannot satisfy both standards simultaneously — a self-closing hinge is evaluated under A156.17, while a standard butt hinge is evaluated under A156.1.</p>

<h3>A156.26 — Continuous Hinges</h3>
<p>ANSI/BHMA A156.26 covers full-length continuous hinges (piano hinges). Like A156.1, it uses a separate grade system. Some continuous hinges are also self-closing; those products may need to be evaluated under both A156.26 and A156.17 depending on their intended application.</p>

<h2>Specifying A156.17 Hinges</h2>

<p>Architects and specifiers include A156.17 requirements in project specifications to ensure that installed hardware meets the performance level required for each opening. The standard is referenced in CSI MasterFormat under:</p>

<p><code>Section 08 71 00 — Door Hardware</code></p>

<h3>Example Specification Language</h3>
<p>A typical specification clause for a fire-rated opening might read:</p>

<blockquote>
  "Self-closing hinges: ANSI/BHMA A156.17 Grade 1, UL-listed for fire-rated door assemblies. Minimum 1,000,000-cycle rating. Hydraulic mechanism with field-adjustable closing speed meeting ICC A117.1 accessibility requirements. Material: 304 stainless steel. Finish: US32D (satin stainless). Provide minimum two (2) self-closing hinges per door leaf."
</blockquote>

<h3>Key Items to Specify</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Grade</strong> — always specify Grade 1 for fire-rated openings; Grade 2 or 3 may be acceptable for non-fire-rated interior doors</li>
  <li><strong>Material</strong> — 304 stainless steel for corrosion resistance; carbon steel with appropriate finish for interior use</li>
  <li><strong>Finish</strong> — specify using BHMA/US finish designations (e.g., US26D, US32D, US10B)</li>
  <li><strong>Fire rating</strong> — confirm UL listing is required and specify the required fire-resistance duration (20-min, 45-min, 60-min, 90-min, 3-hour)</li>
  <li><strong>Quantity</strong> — NFPA 80 requires one hinge per 30 inches of door height; most commercial doors require minimum 3 hinges</li>
  <li><strong>ADA compliance</strong> — specify that closing speed shall be field-adjustable to meet ICC A117.1 Section 404.2.8.1</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="faq-item">
  <p>Q: What does ANSI/BHMA A156.17 cover?</p>
  <p>A156.17 covers self-closing hinges and pivots — door hinges that include a built-in mechanism (spring, hydraulic, or combination) to automatically return the door to its closed position. The standard defines three performance grades (Grade 1, 2, 3) based on cycle endurance testing, and also establishes requirements for closing force, opening force, closing speed, and corrosion resistance. It does not cover standard non-closing butt hinges (A156.1) or continuous hinges (A156.26).</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <p>Q: What is the difference between Grade 1, Grade 2, and Grade 3?</p>
  <p>The grades represent increasing levels of durability based on cycle testing: Grade 3 requires 250,000+ cycles and is suitable for residential and light commercial use; Grade 2 requires 500,000+ cycles for standard commercial applications; Grade 1 requires 1,000,000+ cycles and is the only grade approved for high-traffic commercial use and fire-rated door assemblies. Grade designations are not interchangeable between different BHMA standards — A156.17 Grade 1 and A156.1 Grade 1 measure different things.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <p>Q: Is Grade 1 required for fire doors?</p>
  <p>Yes. NFPA 80, the national standard for fire door assemblies, requires that any self-closing hinge used on a fire-rated door must be A156.17 Grade 1 listed. This is a mandatory requirement enforced by the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) during inspection. Grades 2 and 3 are not permitted on fire-rated openings under any circumstances, regardless of manufacturer claims or door traffic level.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <p>Q: How is cycle testing performed?</p>
  <p>Cycle testing is conducted by accredited third-party testing laboratories using a mechanical fixture that mounts the hinge and drives it through repeated open-and-close cycles at a controlled, consistent pace. One cycle equals the hinge being fully opened and then fully closed. The hinge must complete all required cycles (250,000 / 500,000 / 1,000,000 depending on claimed grade) without losing self-closing function or failing structurally. After testing, the hinge is re-evaluated for operational performance — closing force, opening force, and closing speed — to confirm it still meets grade criteria.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <p>Q: Where can I purchase the A156.17 standard document?</p>
  <p>The ANSI/BHMA A156.17 standard document is available for purchase directly from BHMA (Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association) at bhma.org, or through ANSI's eStandards Store at webstore.ansi.org. The document provides the complete technical requirements, test procedures, and acceptance criteria used by manufacturers and testing laboratories.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <p>Q: What is the current version of A156.17?</p>
  <p>BHMA periodically revises A156.17 as testing methods and product technology evolve. Always verify the edition year when referencing the standard in project specifications, as earlier editions may not reflect current test requirements. For fire-rated applications, confirm with the AHJ which edition is being enforced locally. Waterson self-closing hinges are tested and certified to the current edition of A156.17 at Grade 1.</p>
