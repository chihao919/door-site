<h1>Concealed Hinges &mdash; Types, Installation &amp; Application Guide</h1>

<blockquote>
  A concealed hinge (also called an invisible hinge, hidden hinge, or European hinge) is a hinge whose entire mechanism &mdash; leaves, knuckle, and pivot &mdash; is hidden inside the door and frame when the door is closed. No hardware is visible from the outside, producing a clean, uninterrupted surface. Used in high-end cabinetry, architectural interior doors, and security-sensitive applications, concealed hinges offer three-axis field adjustment, tamper-proof geometry, and a premium aesthetic that standard butt hinges cannot match.

<h2>What Are Concealed Hinges?</h2>

<p>A concealed hinge is any hinge whose pivot mechanism is fully recessed within the body of the door and the door frame, so that when the door is closed, no hardware is visible on either face. This is in direct contrast to a standard butt hinge, where the two leaves and the knuckle (barrel) are visible on the edge between the door and the frame, and a surface-mounted hinge, where hardware is visible on the door face.</p>

<p>The term "concealed hinge" covers two distinct product categories that share the same aesthetic goal but differ substantially in construction and application:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cup hinges (European hinges):</strong> The dominant hinge type in the global cabinet and furniture industry. A circular cup is pressed into a bored hole in the back of the door panel. The arm connects the cup to a mounting plate on the cabinet carcass. Cup hinges allow tool-free adjustment and fast door removal, making them the standard for kitchen cabinets, wardrobe doors, and furniture worldwide.</li>
  <li><strong>Architectural concealed hinges:</strong> Designed for full-size interior and exterior doors in residential and commercial construction. The hinge mechanism is mortised into both the door edge and the frame in a more complex pocket than a standard butt hinge. These hinges support significantly higher loads and may include fire ratings, security certifications, or access control integration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both types share the defining characteristic: when the door is closed, no hinge hardware is visible from either face of the door or from the exterior of the frame. This visual cleanliness is the principal reason architects, interior designers, and security specialists specify concealed hinges.</p>

<h2>How Concealed Hinges Work</h2>

<p>Despite their hidden appearance, concealed hinges use the same fundamental rotational pivot mechanics as all hinges. The key engineering challenge they solve is routing the pivot point to a location that allows the door to swing fully open while keeping all hardware recessed below the door and frame surfaces.</p>

<h3>Cup Hinge Mechanism (Cabinet Applications)</h3>
<p>A cup hinge consists of two main assemblies: the cup (which mounts in the door) and the baseplate (which mounts on the cabinet carcass). The cup contains an articulating arm mechanism &mdash; typically a four-bar linkage &mdash; that controls the door's arc of travel. When the door opens, the linkage rotates around the pivot point inside the cup, pulling the door clear of the cabinet face before swinging it outward. This geometry allows the door to open 90 to 120 degrees (full overlay) or 170 degrees (wide-angle models) while keeping the cup and its pivot entirely behind the door face. The baseplate accepts the cup assembly with a snap-on or clip connection, allowing tool-free door removal by pressing a release lever.</p>

<h3>Architectural Concealed Hinge Mechanism (Door Applications)</h3>
<p>Architectural concealed hinges use a more robust pivot geometry. A pivot pin or multi-axis bearing set is housed within a body that is mortised into the door edge. The corresponding frame leaf is mortised into the door frame. When the door swings, the pivot operates entirely within the mortised pockets. On heavier commercial models, ball bearings or precision pivot rods distribute door weight across a larger bearing surface, enabling them to support loads far exceeding what a cabinet cup hinge could manage. The door edge shows only a narrow gap line &mdash; no leaf face, no barrel, no pin.</p>

<h2>Types of Concealed Hinges</h2>

<h3>Full Overlay Cup Hinges</h3>
<p>Full overlay cup hinges are the most common type in kitchen and wardrobe cabinetry. The door panel completely covers the face of the cabinet frame (also called the face frame or carcass edge) when closed. A full overlay arm geometry positions the cup pivot point so the door face sits flush over the entire frame edge. Standard overlay is typically 9&ndash;13 mm (approximately 3/8" to 1/2"). Full overlay hinges are used when adjacent doors share a common partition wall inside the cabinet carcass, each door covering its own half of the partition.</p>

<h3>Half Overlay Cup Hinges</h3>
<p>Half overlay cup hinges (also called half-cover hinges) are specified when two doors share a single center partition panel. Each door covers only half the thickness of the shared partition rather than the full edge. The arm geometry of a half overlay hinge produces a smaller overlay distance (typically 3&ndash;5 mm) compared to a full overlay hinge, positioning the door face so the pair of doors meets precisely at the centerline of the shared partition without gap or interference.</p>

<h3>Inset (Flush) Cup Hinges</h3>
<p>Inset hinges are designed for doors that sit fully inside the cabinet opening, with the door face flush with (or slightly inset from) the cabinet frame face. This is common in face-frame cabinetry and traditional furniture styles. Inset cup hinges have an arm geometry with zero overlay: the door face aligns exactly with the frame face when closed. Inset applications require more precise construction tolerances because the door must clear the frame on all sides without visible gaps that are too large or too small.</p>

<h3>3D Adjustable Concealed Hinges</h3>
<p>Modern concealed hinges &mdash; particularly architectural door hinges &mdash; offer three-dimensional post-installation adjustment. Three independent adjustment screws control:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Vertical adjustment (up/down):</strong> Raises or lowers the door relative to the frame without removing it. Compensates for building settlement, subfloor variation, or initial installation error.</li>
  <li><strong>Horizontal adjustment (side to side):</strong> Shifts the door laterally within the frame opening. Corrects gaps that are uneven across the height of the door.</li>
  <li><strong>Depth adjustment (in/out):</strong> Moves the door face closer to or farther from the frame face. Corrects a door that protrudes beyond the frame plane or sits recessed within it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Three-axis adjustment is a significant operational advantage over traditional butt hinges, which require shimming or re-mortising to correct misalignment. With a 3D adjustable concealed hinge, a single installer with a hex key can align a door precisely after installation in minutes rather than hours.</p>

<h3>Wide-Angle and 180-Degree Concealed Hinges</h3>
<p>Standard cup hinges open to approximately 110&ndash;120 degrees. Wide-angle variants use a modified linkage geometry to achieve 170 degrees of opening &mdash; useful for corner cabinet installations where the adjacent wall would otherwise limit access. Some architectural concealed hinges are designed to allow a door to swing a full 180 degrees and lie flat against the adjacent wall, maximizing the clear opening width in corridors or high-traffic passageways.</p>

<h3>Concealed Barrel Hinges (Soss-Style Hinges)</h3>
<p>A specialty category of architectural concealed hinge, barrel hinges (commercially known by the brand name Soss) use a cylindrical barrel inserted into a mortised slot in the door edge and frame. The barrel contains a series of pivot links that fold as the door swings, keeping the entire mechanism within the door thickness. Barrel hinges leave only a tiny slit visible at the door edge &mdash; often described as "invisible" even with the door ajar. They are popular for high-end interior doors, secret passages, and furniture applications where maximum concealment is required at all angles of opening.</p>

<h2>Door Applications vs. Cabinet Applications</h2>

<p>Concealed hinges serve fundamentally different markets with different performance requirements. Understanding the distinction is essential when specifying.</p>

<h3>Cabinet Applications</h3>
<p>Cabinet cup hinges are engineered for panel doors weighing 5 to 50 lbs, on carcasses built from sheet materials (plywood, MDF, particleboard). The 35 mm cup bore is an industry-standard dimension established by Blum and adopted globally, allowing hinges from many manufacturers to be interchangeable on the same mounting plates. Cabinet concealed hinges prioritize fast installation (snap-on baseplate), easy door removal for shipping, and tool-free or single-screw adjustment. Cycle life ratings for cabinet hinges are typically 100,000&ndash;200,000 cycles &mdash; appropriate for residential use but not commercial high-traffic applications.</p>

<h3>Architectural Door Applications</h3>
<p>Architectural concealed hinges for full-size doors must support door weights from 50 lbs (hollow-core interior) to 300 lbs or more (solid hardwood or steel security doors). They must withstand the leverage forces generated by wide, tall, or heavy doors and maintain precise alignment over decades of use. Commercial models typically use stainless steel bodies, precision ball bearings, and corrosion-resistant finishes. Some carry UL fire ratings, ANSI/BHMA cycle ratings, and security certifications. Installation requires more elaborate routing than a cabinet cup bore, but the resulting concealment and performance are significantly more robust.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Concealed Hinges</h2>

<h3>Clean Aesthetics and Design Flexibility</h3>
<p>The primary reason concealed hinges are specified is their appearance. By hiding all hardware, they allow the door to present as an uninterrupted surface &mdash; a flat panel of wood, glass, metal, or composite with no visible attachment points. This is particularly valued in minimalist architecture, high-end residential interiors, hospitality design, and retail environments where hardware visibility would interrupt a carefully designed surface treatment. Concealed hinges also allow the door surface to carry continuous veneers, wallcoverings, or mirror panels across the full door face without interruption at the hinge location.</p>

<h3>Tamper Resistance and Security</h3>
<p>Standard outswing doors with exposed butt hinges present a known forced-entry vulnerability: the hinge pin can be driven out with a nail and hammer, separating the hinge leaves and allowing the door to be pulled away from the frame on the hinge side, bypassing the lock entirely. Concealed hinges eliminate this attack vector. With no exposed pin and no accessible hinge hardware on either face of the door, pin-removal attacks are physically impossible. For security doors, vault rooms, server rooms, and high-value residential applications, concealed hinges provide a meaningful security improvement over standard butt hinges.</p>

<h3>Three-Axis Adjustability</h3>
<p>Modern 3D adjustable concealed hinges allow vertical, horizontal, and depth adjustment after installation without removing the door. This feature dramatically reduces the time and skill required to achieve a properly aligned door, compensates for dimensional variations in door frames and rough openings, and allows easy re-alignment after building settlement. In commercial construction where dozens or hundreds of doors must be installed on a tight schedule, the time savings from tool-free 3D adjustment can be substantial.</p>

<h3>Soft-Close Integration</h3>
<p>Many concealed cup hinges and some architectural concealed hinges are available with integrated soft-close dampers. A small hydraulic cartridge inside the hinge arm engages in the final 15&ndash;30 degrees of closing, slowing the door to a controlled, silent stop. This eliminates door slam noise in residential and commercial environments and reduces wear on door panels, frames, and latch hardware. Soft-close concealed hinges are now standard in premium kitchen cabinetry and are increasingly specified for interior architectural doors in hospitality and residential construction.</p>

<h2>Disadvantages of Concealed Hinges</h2>

<h3>Complex Installation &mdash; Routing Required</h3>
<p>Concealed hinges cannot be surface-mounted. Cup hinges require a precisely dimensioned circular bore (typically 35 mm diameter, 12&ndash;13 mm deep) on the back face of the door panel. Architectural concealed hinges require a mortised pocket in the door edge and frame that is more complex in geometry than a standard butt hinge mortise. Both operations require specialized tooling: a 35 mm Forstner bit or hinge boring machine for cup hinges, and a router with a template for architectural models. Installation errors &mdash; an off-center bore, a pocket that is too deep or too shallow &mdash; can compromise door alignment and are difficult to correct without replacing the door panel or frame component.</p>

<h3>Higher Cost</h3>
<p>Concealed hinges cost more than equivalent-capacity butt hinges at every price tier. Cabinet cup hinges are relatively affordable at retail, but architectural concealed hinges for heavy commercial doors can cost several times the price of a comparably rated butt hinge. The additional cost reflects the more complex internal mechanism, tighter manufacturing tolerances, and the 3D adjustment hardware. For projects where aesthetics are not the priority, the additional cost of concealed hinges may not be justified.</p>

<h3>Weight Limitations in Cabinet Applications</h3>
<p>Cabinet-style cup hinges are designed for panel doors, not structural loads. A typical 35 mm cup hinge is rated for 20&ndash;40 lbs per door with two or three hinges. Exceeding the weight rating causes sag, cup pullout from the substrate, or fatigue failure of the arm linkage. Heavy glass doors, solid hardwood panels, or oversized cabinet doors may exceed the capacity of standard cup hinges and require either more hinges per door, heavy-duty cup hinge variants, or a switch to architectural concealed hinges.</p>

<h3>Substrate Dependency</h3>
<p>Cup hinges are designed for sheet-material substrates (plywood, MDF, melamine-coated particleboard) with consistent density through the panel thickness. Solid wood panels with knots, grain discontinuities, or low-density species may not provide adequate holding strength for the cup bore. In these cases, the cup can pull out under repeated load cycles. Architectural concealed hinges for solid wood or engineered lumber doors require careful specification of the routing depth and fastener type to ensure adequate holding strength in the substrate material.</p>

<h2>Materials and Finishes</h2>

<p>Concealed hinges are manufactured in a range of materials matched to the environment and aesthetic requirements of each application:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Zinc die-cast:</strong> The standard material for residential and light commercial cabinet cup hinges. Zinc offers good corrosion resistance, accepts a variety of surface finishes (nickel, chrome, matte black, bronze), and is economical to produce in high volume. Not suitable for wet or marine environments.</li>
  <li><strong>Steel (zinc-plated or powder-coated):</strong> Used for heavier architectural concealed hinges where higher tensile strength is required. Zinc plating provides basic corrosion protection; powder coating provides both protection and color matching to door hardware finishes.</li>
  <li><strong>Stainless steel (304 or 316):</strong> Specified for exterior applications, coastal environments, food service, healthcare, and any installation where corrosion resistance is critical. Grade 316 (marine-grade) provides superior resistance to chloride environments. Stainless architectural concealed hinges are available for high-security and heavy-duty applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Brass:</strong> Used for premium residential and hospitality applications where a warm metallic tone is desired. Brass concealed hinges are typically solid brass bodies with lacquer or living finish options. Higher cost than zinc or steel, but provides excellent corrosion resistance and a distinctive aesthetic.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fire-Rated Concealed Hinges</h2>

<p>A subset of architectural concealed hinges carries UL fire ratings, making them suitable for use on UL-listed fire door assemblies under NFPA 80. Fire-rated concealed hinges must be tested and listed for the fire-rating duration of the door assembly: 20-minute, 45-minute, 60-minute, 90-minute, or 3-hour ratings are the standard categories.</p>

<p>Key requirements for fire-rated concealed hinge applications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The hinge must be part of a UL-listed fire door assembly. Using a fire-rated hinge on a non-listed door, or a non-rated hinge on a fire door, both result in a non-compliant assembly.</li>
  <li>NFPA 80 requires a minimum of two hinges per fire door leaf, plus one additional hinge for every 30 inches of door height above 60 inches.</li>
  <li>Fire-rated concealed hinges are typically required to be installed by a credentialed installer, with the installation documented in the door assembly's permanent record.</li>
  <li>Annual inspection per NFPA 80 Section 5.2 must verify that the concealed hinges are functioning, properly adjusted, and show no signs of damage or wear that would compromise their fire performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all concealed hinge products are fire-rated. When specifying for fire doors, explicitly confirm the UL listing and fire-rating duration with the manufacturer before ordering.</p>

<h2>Security Applications &mdash; No Exposed Pin</h2>

<p>The security implications of concealed hinges are significant enough to merit separate treatment. In standard butt hinge installations on outswing doors, the hinge pin is on the exterior (accessible) side. Removing the pin &mdash; a simple operation requiring a hammer and a common nail &mdash; allows an attacker to lift the door away from the frame on the hinge side, bypassing any lock regardless of its quality or security rating.</p>

<p>Concealed hinges eliminate this vulnerability entirely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is no exposed pin. The pivot mechanism is entirely recessed inside the door and frame bodies, inaccessible from either face.</li>
  <li>The hinge mechanism is protected by the door and frame material. To access the hinge, an attacker would need to destroy the door or frame material surrounding the concealed pocket &mdash; a far more visible, time-consuming, and difficult attack than pin removal.</li>
  <li>The absence of visible hardware also removes the visual cue that identifies where hinge hardware is located, raising the barrier for opportunistic attacks.</li>
</ul>

<p>For this reason, concealed hinges are commonly specified for server rooms, data centers, safe rooms, medical drug storage, and high-value residential entry doors where the door's hinge side faces a publicly accessible area.</p>

<h2>Commercial vs. Residential Use</h2>

<h3>Residential Applications</h3>
<p>In residential settings, concealed hinges appear most frequently in kitchen cabinetry, wardrobe and closet doors, built-in furniture, and premium interior doors. Cup hinges dominate the residential cabinet market globally. Residential architectural concealed hinges are specified for high-end custom homes where the interior designer requires hardware-free door surfaces, or for security-upgraded entry doors where hinge-side vulnerability is a concern. Residential concealed hinges are typically lighter-duty than commercial models, rated for lower cycle counts and door weights consistent with residential traffic levels.</p>

<h3>Commercial Applications</h3>
<p>Commercial specifications for concealed hinges appear in hospitality (hotel room doors, lobby feature doors), retail (dressing room doors, display cabinet doors), healthcare (cleanroom and pharmacy doors), education (classroom and laboratory doors), and high-security facilities (server rooms, evidence rooms, secure offices). Commercial concealed hinges must meet higher cycle ratings &mdash; ANSI/BHMA Grade 1 requires 1,000,000 cycles minimum &mdash; and must support heavier door weights than residential equivalents. Fire rating and ADA compliance requirements are more common in commercial projects and must be verified at the specification stage.</p>

<h2>Installation Steps</h2>

<p>Proper installation is critical for concealed hinges to function correctly and maintain alignment over time. The following steps apply to architectural concealed hinges for full-size doors; cabinet cup hinge installation uses a simplified version of the same principles.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Measure and mark hinge locations:</strong> Mark hinge centerlines on the door edge and corresponding frame locations. Standard placement for architectural doors: top hinge 5 inches from the top of the door, bottom hinge 10 inches from the bottom, intermediate hinges evenly spaced. Follow the manufacturer's template dimensions exactly.</li>
  <li><strong>Rout the door pocket:</strong> Using a router and the manufacturer's template, cut the hinge pocket into the door edge to the specified depth, width, and length. Test-fit the hinge body. The hinge should seat flush with the door edge surface &mdash; not proud, not recessed.</li>
  <li><strong>Rout the frame pocket:</strong> Repeat the routing operation on the corresponding frame location. The frame pocket geometry may differ from the door pocket &mdash; use the manufacturer's frame-side template.</li>
  <li><strong>Install the hinge body in the door:</strong> Secure the door-side hinge body with the specified fasteners (typically stainless steel screws). Apply thread-locking compound if specified by the manufacturer for high-cycle or high-load applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Install the frame leaf:</strong> Secure the frame-side component in the frame pocket. Confirm that both components are at exactly the same height before tightening.</li>
  <li><strong>Hang the door:</strong> Engage the door-side and frame-side hinge components. Most architectural concealed hinges use a pin, clip, or threaded engagement that allows the door to be hung and removed without tools.</li>
  <li><strong>Adjust alignment:</strong> Use the three adjustment screws to align the door within the frame: vertical, horizontal, and depth. Check that gaps are even on all four sides of the door. Verify that the door opens and closes smoothly through its full range of motion.</li>
  <li><strong>Final torque and check:</strong> Tighten all adjustment screws and fasteners to the manufacturer's specified torque. Open and close the door 20&ndash;30 times to verify that alignment is maintained. Check for any binding, rubbing, or uneven gaps that develop after cycling.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Adjustment After Installation</h2>

<p>One of the most practical advantages of 3D adjustable concealed hinges is the ability to re-align a door without removing it. This is particularly valuable in commercial construction where building settlement, wood movement, or initial installation variations can cause door gaps to shift over the first months of building occupancy.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Vertical adjustment:</strong> Turn the vertical adjustment screw (typically accessible from the hinge body side or through the door face where a cover cap has been removed) clockwise to raise the door, counterclockwise to lower it. Adjust in small increments &mdash; a full turn often produces 1 mm of movement.</li>
  <li><strong>Horizontal adjustment:</strong> The horizontal screw shifts the door left or right relative to the frame. This corrects uneven side gaps along the door height. Adjust both hinges equally when correcting a parallel gap problem; adjust them differentially to correct a tapered gap.</li>
  <li><strong>Depth adjustment:</strong> The depth screw moves the door face in or out relative to the frame face plane. This corrects a door that sits proud of (protrudes beyond) or recessed within the frame. Depth adjustment is particularly useful for doors in thick walls where the frame and door must be precisely co-planar with the wall surface.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="faq-item">
  <p><strong>Q: What is a concealed hinge?</strong></p>
  <p>A: A concealed hinge (also called an invisible hinge, hidden hinge, or European hinge) is a hinge whose leaves, knuckle, and pivot mechanism are entirely hidden inside the door and frame when the door is closed. No hardware is visible from the exterior, producing a clean, uninterrupted surface. Concealed hinges are widely used in high-end cabinetry, architectural interior doors, and security applications where tamper resistance or aesthetic purity is required.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <p><strong>Q: What is the difference between full overlay, half overlay, and inset concealed hinges?</strong></p>
  <p>A: These terms describe how the cabinet door leaf overlaps the frame or carcass edge. Full overlay hinges position the door face to completely cover the cabinet frame edge. Half overlay hinges are used when two doors share a single center partition, each covering half of it. Inset hinges are designed for doors that sit fully inside the frame opening, flush with the frame face. The overlay dimension determines which cup hinge geometry and arm type is required &mdash; using the wrong overlay type results in misaligned doors and interference between adjacent panels.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <p><strong>Q: Do concealed hinges require routing?</strong></p>
  <p>A: Yes. Cabinet-style cup hinges require a shallow circular recess (typically 35 mm diameter, 12&ndash;13 mm deep) bored into the back face of the door panel to accept the hinge cup. Architectural concealed hinges for full-size doors require a mortise pocket routed into both the door edge and the frame. Unlike standard butt hinges, concealed hinges cannot be surface-mounted &mdash; the routing or boring step is mandatory for proper installation and flush door operation. Precision is critical: an off-center bore or incorrect pocket depth compromises door alignment and is difficult to correct after the fact.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <p><strong>Q: Are concealed hinges adjustable after installation?</strong></p>
  <p>A: Yes. Modern 3D adjustable concealed hinges allow post-installation adjustment in three axes: vertical (up/down), horizontal (side to side), and depth (in/out from the frame face). Adjustments are made with a screwdriver or hex key without removing the door. This three-axis adjustment is a significant advantage over traditional butt hinges, which require shimming or re-mortising to correct door alignment. For commercial projects where dozens of doors must be precisely aligned on a schedule, 3D adjustability can save substantial installation time.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <p><strong>Q: Are concealed hinges suitable for fire-rated doors?</strong></p>
  <p>A: Select concealed hinges are available with fire ratings for use on UL-listed fire door assemblies. Fire-rated concealed hinges must carry a UL listing appropriate to the fire-rating duration of the door assembly (20-minute through 3-hour). When specifying concealed hinges on fire doors, verify that the hinge is part of the listed assembly and meets all NFPA 80 requirements including minimum hinge count per door leaf. Not all concealed hinge products are fire-rated &mdash; confirm the UL listing before specification and procurement.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <p><strong>Q: What are the weight limits for concealed hinges on full-size doors?</strong></p>
  <p>A: Weight capacity varies significantly by hinge model and size. Light-duty architectural concealed hinges support doors up to approximately 100 lbs per pair. Heavy-duty models rated for commercial applications support 150&ndash;200 lbs or more per pair. For heavy doors, use three or more hinges and verify that the total rated capacity exceeds the door weight. Cabinet cup hinges are typically rated for 20&ndash;50 lbs per door panel depending on cup size, arm type, and substrate material. Always verify per-hinge load ratings against actual door weight before specifying.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <p><strong>Q: How do concealed hinges improve security compared to standard butt hinges?</strong></p>
  <p>A: Standard butt hinges expose the hinge pin on the door's pull side. If a door swings outward, the exposed pin can be driven out with a hammer and common nail, allowing the hinge side of the door to be pried away from the frame even when the lock is engaged. Concealed hinges eliminate this attack vector entirely. The pivot mechanism is recessed inside the door and frame, leaving no accessible hardware on either face. Pin-removal attacks are physically impossible, making concealed hinges a meaningful security upgrade for outswing doors in any application where hinge-side forced entry is a concern.</p>
