<h1>Pivot Hinges &mdash; Types, Applications &amp; Installation Guide</h1>

<blockquote>
  A pivot hinge supports a door at a top pivot point mounted in the head frame and a bottom pivot point set into the floor or threshold, rather than along a continuous barrel on the door stile edge. This configuration distributes door weight vertically through the floor structure, enabling single-leaf doors weighing 600 lbs or more to operate smoothly. Pivot hinges are the preferred choice for heavy commercial entrance doors, frameless glass doors, architectural feature doors, and restaurant kitchen pass-throughs where bi-directional swing is required.

<h2>What Is a Pivot Hinge?</h2>

<p>A pivot hinge is a door support system that rotates on two vertically aligned pivot points — one at the top of the door assembly and one at the bottom — rather than along a series of knuckle-and-pin barrel hinges mortised into the door edge. The bottom pivot, which carries the majority of the door weight, is typically set into a floor housing or anchored to a floor plate. The top pivot, which maintains lateral alignment and prevents racking, is mounted in the underside of the head frame or door transom bar.</p>

<p>Because the door load is transferred vertically through the floor pivot into the building's structural slab rather than horizontally through the frame stile, pivot hinges can handle door weights far exceeding the practical limits of standard butt hinges. A single pair of 4-1/2-inch butt hinges is typically rated for doors up to 200 lbs under ideal conditions; heavy-duty pivot hinge systems routinely support doors of 400–600 lbs, and some specialized floor-spring pivot systems are engineered for panels approaching 1,000 lbs.</p>

<p>The pivot mechanism also allows the rotation axis to be positioned at any point across the door thickness — or even behind the door face — giving architects and designers significant freedom over how the door appears and performs in the opening. This is the basis for the three primary pivot hinge types: center pivot, offset pivot, and intermediate pivot.</p>

<h2>How a Pivot Hinge Works</h2>

<p>Understanding pivot hinge mechanics starts with the two-point support geometry. In a conventional butt-hinge installation, the door is supported along the entire height of the hinge stile, and the rotational axis runs directly through the barrel centerline at the edge of the door. The frame must resist both the weight of the door and the cantilever moment generated as the door swings open.</p>

<p>In a pivot hinge system, this load path changes fundamentally:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Bottom pivot (load-bearing):</strong> The floor pivot housing is set into a prepared floor pocket or surface-mounted to a structural anchor plate. A pivot pin extends upward from the housing into a receiver plate mortised into the bottom rail of the door. This interface carries the full vertical weight of the door leaf at all times, transferring load directly to the floor slab.</li>
  <li><strong>Top pivot (alignment and lateral stability):</strong> The top pivot is mounted in the underside of the frame head or a transom bar. A matching receiver mortised into the top rail of the door engages the top pivot to prevent the door from racking or tipping under lateral forces. The top pivot carries minimal vertical load but is critical for maintaining square alignment throughout the swing arc.</li>
  <li><strong>Swing arc:</strong> As the door opens, both the door face and the hinge stile edge sweep an arc determined by the horizontal offset of the pivot axis from the door face. In a center pivot, both edges sweep equal arcs. In an offset pivot, the trailing (hinge) side sweeps a smaller arc, keeping the hinge hardware nearly flush with the frame when the door is closed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some commercial pivot systems integrate a floor-spring mechanism into the bottom floor housing. The spring provides a controlled closing force and, in some designs, a hold-open function at a specified angle (typically 90 degrees). Hydraulic floor closers combine a spring with a hydraulic circuit for speed control, operating on the same principle as a concealed floor closer.</p>

<h2>Types of Pivot Hinges</h2>

<h3>Center Pivot Hinge</h3>
<p>A center pivot hinge positions the rotation axis at the horizontal midpoint of the door thickness. When the door swings, both the leading edge and the hinge stile edge sweep equal and opposite arcs. This geometry is the natural choice for bi-directional swing — the door opens freely in either direction without the leading edge striking the frame stop. Center pivot hinges are used on restaurant kitchen pass-through doors, hospital corridor doors requiring traffic in both directions, and any application where two-way swing is functionally necessary.</p>

<p>The primary trade-off of center pivoting is visual and spatial: because both edges sweep outward, the door occupies more clearance on both sides of the opening when swinging. Additionally, the pivot hardware is visible on both door faces when the door is viewed from the side, which may not suit every architectural program.</p>

<h3>Offset Pivot Hinge</h3>
<p>An offset pivot hinge moves the rotation axis away from the geometric center of the door toward the hinge stile, typically by 3/4 inch to 1-1/2 inches from the door face. This offset causes the door to swing predominantly in one direction — the leading edge travels through a larger arc while the hinge stile trails by a smaller amount and remains close to the frame. The result is that the pivot hardware, when the door is closed, sits nearly flush with or slightly behind the frame face, creating a cleaner visual profile than a center pivot installation.</p>

<p>Offset pivot hinges are by far the most common pivot type in commercial storefront and entrance applications. The offset also allows the door to clear a protruding frame stop or a recessed frame stop on the opposite side, depending on the offset direction. When a wider swing clearance on the hinge side is acceptable, the offset configuration provides the most architecturally integrated appearance.</p>

<h3>Intermediate (Mid-Height) Pivot</h3>
<p>Tall door panels — particularly those exceeding 8 or 10 feet in height — may flex or bow under their own weight along the unsupported center span between the top and bottom pivots. An intermediate pivot, also called a mid-height or center-rail pivot, adds a third support point at the approximate mid-height of the door. This intermediate pivot does not rotate independently but rather provides lateral restraint and prevents deflection in the center of the door panel.</p>

<p>Intermediate pivots are common on monumental wood doors in hotel lobbies, institutional buildings, and courthouses where door heights of 10 to 14 feet are specified. They are also used on glass pivot doors where the glazed panel must remain flat across its full height to maintain a watertight seal at the perimeter gaskets.</p>

<h2>Floor-Mounted vs. Frame-Mounted Pivot Systems</h2>

<h3>Floor-Mounted Bottom Pivot</h3>
<p>The most common commercial pivot installation uses a floor-mounted bottom pivot housing. A floor pocket — typically 3 to 4 inches deep and 4 to 6 inches in diameter — is cut into the structural slab before the finish floor is applied. The pivot housing is set in the pocket and anchored to the structural concrete with expansion bolts or epoxy anchors. After installation, only the pivot pin and a minimal cover plate are visible at floor level.</p>

<p>Floor-mounted bottom pivots provide the greatest load capacity because the pivot housing is directly anchored to the structural slab with a large bearing area. The floor slab, not the frame, carries the full door weight. This is why floor pivot systems are the standard for doors exceeding 200 lbs per leaf.</p>

<p>The principal disadvantage is the floor preparation required. In existing buildings, cutting a floor pocket in a structural concrete slab is a significant undertaking, particularly if post-tensioned reinforcement is present (cutting post-tensioned cables is a serious structural issue). In renovation projects, the floor finish type and depth must be verified to ensure that a floor pocket of adequate depth can be created without compromising the slab integrity.</p>

<h3>Threshold / Floor-Plate-Mounted Bottom Pivot</h3>
<p>When a full floor pocket is impractical, a surface-mounted floor plate can be used. The floor plate is bolted to the structural substrate through the finish floor, and the pivot housing is integrated into the plate. This approach avoids cutting a deep pocket but requires a structural substrate within a few inches of the floor surface capable of accepting the anchor bolts. Surface-mounted floor plates are also more visible than fully recessed floor pivots, which may affect appearance in high-end architectural installations.</p>

<p>Threshold-mounted pivots position the bottom pivot at the threshold level rather than flush with the finished floor. This simplifies installation in retrofit situations but results in a slightly raised pivot point that may create a minor ADA threshold condition if the threshold height exceeds 1/2 inch (1/4 inch for cross-slope thresholds on accessible routes).</p>

<h3>Frame-Mounted (Top and Bottom in Frame) Systems</h3>
<p>Some lighter-duty pivot systems mount both the top and bottom pivots in the door frame rather than the floor. The bottom pivot mounts in the frame sill or threshold, and the top pivot mounts in the frame head. This eliminates floor preparation entirely but limits the weight capacity substantially, since the bottom pivot load is transferred through the frame rather than directly to the floor slab. Frame-mounted systems are used for interior pivot doors of moderate weight — typically up to 150 lbs — where the architectural benefit of a pivot appearance is desired without the complexity of a floor installation.</p>

<h2>Pivot Hinge Advantages</h2>

<h3>Heavy Door Capacity</h3>
<p>The most compelling reason to specify pivot hinges is their ability to support very heavy door panels. When door weight approaches or exceeds 200–300 lbs, the cantilever forces imposed on a butt-hinge frame become structurally significant and can lead to frame deflection, hinge wear, and difficult door operation over time. Pivot hinges transfer the vertical load directly to the floor structure, allowing doors of 400, 600, or even 800 lbs to operate with the same ease as a much lighter door on butt hinges. This opens the design vocabulary to include thick hardwood slabs, heavy metal cladding, oversized glass, and dense stone veneer finishes that are simply not achievable with conventional hinge systems.</p>

<h3>Bi-Directional Swing (Center Pivot)</h3>
<p>Center pivot hinges enable a door to swing in both directions from a single pivot axis. This is a functional requirement in applications where pedestrian or cart traffic flows in both directions through a single opening — restaurant kitchens, hospital utility corridors, food processing facilities, and commercial laundries. Without a bi-directional pivot, each direction of travel requires a separate door leaf and a more complex frame configuration.</p>

<h3>Reduced Visible Hardware</h3>
<p>Offset pivot hinges, in particular, produce a very clean visual appearance at the opening. With the pivot hardware concealed behind the door edge and the frame stop, and no barrel-and-pin assembly visible along the hinge stile, the door appears to float freely in the opening. This minimalist hardware profile is highly valued in high-end retail, hotel lobby, corporate headquarters, and gallery applications where architectural integration and visual simplicity are design priorities.</p>

<h3>Structural Floor Load Transfer</h3>
<p>Because the floor pivot transfers door weight directly to the concrete slab, pivot hinge installations are significantly less demanding on the door frame than butt-hinge installations for the same door weight. The frame must still provide lateral stability and resist wind loads or door-impact forces, but it is relieved of the heavy cantilever moment that butt-hinge doors impose. This is particularly important when the frame material is aluminum storefront extrusion, which has limited moment-resistance capacity compared to heavy steel frames.</p>

<h3>Long Service Life</h3>
<p>Quality pivot hinge systems made from hardened stainless steel or bronze pivot components and solid pivot pins are extremely durable. Because the bearing surfaces are large and the load is distributed through the floor structure rather than concentrated at hinge knuckle points, wear rates are lower than on butt hinges carrying equivalent door weights. Heavy-duty commercial pivot systems commonly provide 20 or more years of service life with minimal maintenance in high-traffic installations.</p>

<h2>Pivot Hinge Disadvantages</h2>

<h3>Floor Preparation Requirement</h3>
<p>The floor pocket required for a floor-mounted bottom pivot is the most significant practical drawback of pivot hinge systems. In new construction, floor pockets are straightforward to incorporate into the slab layout. In renovation or tenant-improvement projects, cutting floor pockets in existing concrete slab — particularly post-tensioned or post-stressed slab — requires structural review and is expensive. Even in non-post-tensioned slabs, the cutting process requires specialized equipment, creates construction mess, and must be coordinated with floor finish installation scheduling.</p>

<h3>Limited Fire-Rating Availability</h3>
<p>The vast majority of UL-listed fire door assemblies use butt hinges as the hinge component. While some pivot hinge manufacturers offer UL-listed pivot systems for fire-rated assemblies, the range of listed assemblies is substantially narrower than for butt hinges. Fire-rated pivot door assemblies typically require additional hardware — such as fire-rated bottom seals, specific frame construction, and listed closing devices — that further constrain the specification. Architects and specifiers must verify that the specific pivot hardware, door, and frame combination is covered by a UL listing for the required fire-rating duration.</p>

<h3>Swing Clearance on Both Sides</h3>
<p>Center pivot doors sweep both sides of the opening as they move. In layouts where wall space adjacent to the opening is limited — such as corridors with cross-corridor obstructions, or lobbies where furniture or walls are close to the door sides — the swing clearance required on both sides of a center pivot door may not be available. Offset pivot doors reduce this issue by confining most of the swing to one side, but even offset pivot doors require more side clearance than sliding, folding, or automatic door alternatives.</p>

<h3>Higher Initial Cost</h3>
<p>Pivot hinge hardware — particularly heavy-duty floor spring systems from commercial-grade manufacturers — is significantly more expensive than equivalent butt hinges or continuous hinges for the same opening. The combination of hardware cost, floor preparation cost, and the precision required for correct pivot alignment during installation results in a higher total cost of ownership compared to conventional hinge systems for doors within the weight and size range where butt hinges are viable.</p>

<h3>Installation Precision</h3>
<p>Correct pivot hinge installation requires precise vertical alignment of the top and bottom pivots. If the pivots are not plumb with each other, the door will bind, drag, or fail to latch properly. Achieving this alignment requires careful layout, accurate floor pocket placement, and precise top pivot adjustment — typically with a qualified door hardware installer rather than a general contractor. Misalignment discovered after the floor finish is installed is costly to correct.</p>

<h2>Weight Capacity</h2>

<p>Pivot hinge weight ratings vary significantly by system type and manufacturer. The following general ranges apply to widely available commercial products:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Frame-mounted pivot systems (lightweight):</strong> 100–175 lbs per leaf. Suitable for interior wood doors in residential and light commercial applications where only the pivot appearance is desired.</li>
  <li><strong>Standard commercial floor pivot:</strong> 200–400 lbs per leaf. Covers the majority of commercial solid-wood, hollow-metal, and aluminum-framed glass entrance doors in office buildings, retail, and institutional applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Heavy-duty commercial floor pivot:</strong> 400–600 lbs per leaf. Required for thick solid-wood monumental doors, heavy aluminum-framed glass panels, and doors with substantial metal or stone cladding.</li>
  <li><strong>Extra-heavy-duty / architectural floor-spring systems:</strong> 600–1,000 lbs or more per leaf. Used for monumental pivot doors in hotel lobbies, government buildings, and feature architectural installations. These systems use large-diameter bearing components and deep floor housing assemblies requiring structural engineering review.</li>
</ul>

<p>Door weight should always be calculated including all hardware, glass, cladding, and applied finishes — not just the door substrate. A 3-inch solid hardwood door blank weighing 180 lbs may reach 250 lbs when hardware, glass lites, and finish pulls are added. Verify total weight before selecting a pivot system, and add a safety margin of at least 15–20% to account for shock loading from use.</p>

<h2>Common Applications</h2>

<h3>Heavy Commercial Entrance Doors</h3>
<p>The single most common application for heavy-duty pivot hinges is the primary entrance door of commercial buildings — office lobbies, corporate headquarters, luxury retail, and financial institution branches. These doors are often specified as a visual statement: oversized panels of solid hardwood, thick glass, or metal-clad wood that convey permanence and quality. The pivot hinge is the enabling technology that allows these heavy, architecturally expressive panels to function reliably as high-cycle entrance doors.</p>

<h3>Hotel and Hospitality Entries</h3>
<p>Hotel main entries combine extreme door weight — often 400–700 lbs for solid bronze or thick tempered glass panels — with very high traffic cycles, continuous operation across climate extremes, and an expectation of smooth, silent, effortless operation by guests. Pivot hinges meet all of these requirements simultaneously. The visual minimalism of the offset pivot also aligns with the premium design aesthetic expected in high-end hospitality entries.</p>

<h3>Restaurant Kitchen Pass-Through Doors</h3>
<p>Kitchen pass-through doors between the dining room and kitchen must open freely in both directions for servers carrying trays and kitchen staff. A center pivot hinge is the classic solution: the door swings in either direction from a neutral center position, requires no push bar or pull handle to operate, and closes automatically when released. The door can be made of stainless steel, solid wood, or a composite panel and weighted to provide a reliable gravity return or fitted with a floor spring for controlled closing.</p>

<h3>Frameless Glass Doors</h3>
<p>Frameless all-glass door systems — common in retail storefronts, office entries, and shower enclosures — rely on pivot hardware because the glass panel cannot accept a traditional butt-hinge mortise. The bottom pivot is typically a floor-mounted patch fitting that clamps to the bottom edge of the glass, and the top pivot is a ceiling- or transom-mounted patch fitting. The result is a glass door that appears to float in the opening with no visible frame. Weight capacities for glass pivot systems range from 150 lbs for residential glass doors to 400 lbs or more for commercial floor-spring glass door systems.</p>

<h3>Monumental Architectural Doors</h3>
<p>Government buildings, courthouses, cultural institutions, and religious buildings have a long tradition of specifying oversized entrance doors — sometimes 10 to 14 feet tall and 4 to 6 feet wide — as expressions of civic or institutional significance. These doors, whether in solid hardwood, bronze, or clad steel, routinely weigh 500 to 1,000 lbs per leaf. Pivot hinges with intermediate supports are the only practical means of hanging these panels while achieving reliable, long-life operation.</p>

<h2>Fire-Rated Pivot Hinge Options</h2>

<p>Fire-rated pivot hinge systems exist but are less common than fire-rated butt hinge systems. Several factors make fire rating more complex for pivot hinges:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>UL listing specificity:</strong> A UL-listed fire door assembly is listed as a complete system — door, frame, hinges, latching hardware, closing device, and seals — not as individual components. A pivot hinge used on a fire-rated door must be specifically included in the listing for that assembly. Swapping pivot hardware between assemblies invalidates the listing unless the substituted hardware is explicitly listed as an acceptable alternative in the assembly's UL follow-up service data.</li>
  <li><strong>Floor closure requirement:</strong> NFPA 80 requires that fire doors close and latch positively from any position. A floor-spring pivot system must be verified to provide adequate closing force across the full swing arc, including at small opening angles where spring torque is typically lowest. Some floor-spring systems lose effective closing force at less than 15 degrees of opening, which would fail NFPA 80 compliance testing.</li>
  <li><strong>Positive latching:</strong> Fire-rated pivot doors must latch positively at the strike to maintain the required fire separation. Pivot door latch coordination requires careful hardware scheduling because the latch must engage the strike at the correct door position, which depends on the precise horizontal location of the pivot axis relative to the latch face.</li>
  <li><strong>Available fire ratings:</strong> Most commercially available fire-rated pivot assemblies are rated at 20-minute or 45-minute. 90-minute and 3-hour fire-rated pivot assemblies are rare and may require a custom engineering assessment and project-specific UL follow-up service review.</li>
</ul>

<p>When fire rating is required and pivot hinges are the preferred hardware type, consult with the pivot hinge manufacturer early in the design process to confirm available UL listing data and assemble the hardware schedule accordingly. Do not assume that any pivot hinge can substitute for the listed pivot hardware in a fire-rated assembly.</p>

<h2>ADA Considerations</h2>

<p>The ADA Standards for Accessible Design and ICC A117.1 do not prohibit pivot hinges on accessible route doors, but several parameters must be verified:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Clear opening width:</strong> ADA Section 404.2.3 requires a minimum clear opening width of 32 inches measured from the face of the door to the face of the stop, with the door open 90 degrees. On offset pivot doors, the pivot offset causes the door leaf to project slightly into the opening width on the pivot side when the door is at 90 degrees. Verify that the 32-inch clear width is maintained with the door at 90 degrees, accounting for the pivot offset geometry.</li>
  <li><strong>Maneuvering clearance:</strong> ADA requires specific maneuvering clearances on both sides of accessible route doors. Center pivot doors that swing in both directions require that clearances be maintained on both sides of the opening simultaneously — a constraint that can be difficult to satisfy in tight corridor intersections.</li>
  <li><strong>Opening force:</strong> For interior doors on accessible routes, ADA requires a maximum operating force of 5 lbf. If a floor-spring pivot system provides the closing force, the spring tension must be adjusted or selected so that opening force does not exceed 5 lbf at any point in the swing arc. This is most critical at the beginning of the swing, where spring torque is typically highest.</li>
  <li><strong>Closing speed:</strong> ICC A117.1 Section 404.2.8 requires that doors with closing devices close from 90 degrees to 12 degrees in no less than 5 seconds. A hydraulic floor-spring pivot system with speed adjustment can meet this requirement; a pure mechanical spring system may not, depending on spring tension settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Threshold height:</strong> The bottom pivot housing must not create a threshold obstruction exceeding 1/2 inch in height (1/4 inch for beveled thresholds on accessible routes). Floor-recessed pivot housings that are flush with the finished floor surface satisfy this requirement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation Overview</h2>

<p>Pivot hinge installation is more involved than standard butt hinge installation and typically requires a qualified door hardware installer. The following steps outline the general process for a floor-mounted commercial pivot system:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Layout and floor pocket preparation:</strong> Before the finish floor is applied, mark the centerline of the bottom pivot based on the door design drawings. Cut the floor pocket to the dimensions specified by the pivot housing manufacturer — typically 3 to 4 inches deep, 4 to 6 inches in diameter. Clean the pocket and verify that the concrete substrate is sound and free of rebar or post-tensioning cables in the cutting path. Set and anchor the floor pivot housing in the pocket using epoxy or expansion anchor bolts, verifying plumb and level.</li>
  <li><strong>Frame and top pivot installation:</strong> Install the door frame with the top pivot receiver in the underside of the frame head at the location specified in the hardware drawings. Verify that the top pivot receiver is directly plumb above the center of the floor pivot housing — misalignment of more than 1/16 inch will cause the door to bind.</li>
  <li><strong>Door preparation:</strong> Mortise the door bottom rail for the floor pivot plate and the door top rail for the top pivot plate. Mortise depths must match the manufacturer's requirements precisely — a shallow mortise causes the door to sit high and bind at the top; a deep mortise causes the door to sit low and drag on the floor.</li>
  <li><strong>Door hanging:</strong> With the floor pivot pin retracted or removed, lift the door into position so the top pivot plate engages the top pivot receiver. Lower the door onto the floor pivot pin. Verify that the door hangs plumb and swings freely without binding. Check that the door clears the floor and threshold uniformly across its width.</li>
  <li><strong>Spring adjustment (if floor spring is integrated):</strong> Follow the manufacturer's instructions to set the spring tension. For ADA-compliant applications, measure opening force with a calibrated force gauge at the leading edge of the door at the height most likely to be used by a wheelchair user (approximately 34 inches). Adjust spring tension until opening force is at or below 5 lbf. If a hydraulic speed control is included, adjust the closing speed to meet the required minimum (5 seconds from 90 degrees to 12 degrees for ADA).</li>
  <li><strong>Latch and hardware adjustment:</strong> Install and adjust latching hardware so that the latch bolt engages the strike cleanly when the door is closed. Because pivot geometry can shift the door face position relative to the frame face by the amount of the pivot offset, verify strike placement with the actual pivot system installed rather than dimensioning from theoretical drawings alone.</li>
  <li><strong>Final inspection:</strong> Open the door fully and release it. Verify that the door closes completely and latches from the full-open position, from a 45-degree position, and from a 15-degree position. Verify that the floor pivot housing cover plate is flush with or recessed below the finished floor surface. Document spring tension settings and closing speed measurements for the project closeout record.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Maintenance</h2>

<p>Pivot hinge systems require periodic maintenance to sustain performance over their service life. Key maintenance tasks include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Lubrication:</strong> The pivot pin and bearing surfaces should be lubricated with a light machine oil or dry lubricant at annual or semi-annual intervals, depending on traffic volume. Remove the door if necessary to access the bearing surfaces. Over-lubrication can attract dirt and grit that accelerates wear.</li>
  <li><strong>Pivot pin inspection:</strong> Inspect the pivot pin for wear, scoring, or corrosion at annual service intervals. A worn pivot pin allows the door to develop vertical play, which can cause misalignment of the latch with the strike and accelerate wear at the top pivot receiver. Replace the pivot pin when wear is visible or when vertical play exceeds 1/16 inch.</li>
  <li><strong>Floor housing inspection:</strong> Inspect the floor pivot housing for debris accumulation, corrosion, and anchor looseness. Clear any debris from the housing recess. Check that the housing anchor bolts remain tight — floor vibration in high-traffic areas can cause fastener loosening over time.</li>
  <li><strong>Top pivot inspection:</strong> Verify that the top pivot receiver is firmly anchored in the frame head and that the engagement between the door top pivot plate and the frame receiver remains snug. Looseness at the top pivot allows the door to rack and can stress the floor pivot bearing surfaces.</li>
  <li><strong>Floor spring service (if integrated):</strong> Floor spring mechanisms require periodic lubrication of the internal spring and hydraulic circuit components per the manufacturer's schedule. Some floor springs require re-adjustment of the spring tension or hydraulic valve after the first year of service as components seat and wear-in.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="faq-item">
  <p><strong>Q: What is a pivot hinge and how does it differ from a standard butt hinge?</strong></p>
  <p>A: A pivot hinge supports a door at two points — a top pivot mounted in the head frame and a bottom pivot set into the floor or threshold — rather than along a continuous barrel on the door edge. This geometry transfers door weight vertically through the floor structure, allowing heavier doors to swing freely with far less stress on the frame. Butt hinges are mortised into the door edge and frame face, suit lighter doors, and allow swing in one direction only. Pivot hinges can accommodate bi-directional swing and doors weighing 600 lbs or more, making them the specification standard for monumental entrance doors and architectural feature doors.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <p><strong>Q: What is the maximum weight a pivot hinge can support?</strong></p>
  <p>A: Heavy-duty commercial pivot hinges are rated to support door weights of 600 lbs or more per door leaf. Some specialized floor-spring pivot systems are engineered for doors up to 800–1,000 lbs per leaf. Weight capacity depends on the pivot system design, floor plate anchor strength, structural substrate, and the structural integrity of the top frame receiver. Always verify the manufacturer's rated capacity against the door's actual weight including glass panels, applied hardware, and any cladding or veneer materials, and add a 15–20% safety margin for shock loading from daily use.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <p><strong>Q: What is the difference between a center pivot hinge and an offset pivot hinge?</strong></p>
  <p>A: A center pivot hinge positions the rotation axis at the center of the door thickness, causing both the leading and trailing edges of the door to sweep equal arcs when the door is opened. This enables bi-directional swing. An offset pivot hinge moves the rotation axis to one side — typically 3/4 inch to 1-1/2 inches from the door face — so the door swings predominantly in one direction and the hinge hardware remains nearly flush with or behind the frame face when the door is closed. Offset pivot hinges are more common in commercial storefronts because the offset produces a cleaner visual profile and allows the door to clear frame stops and moldings.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <p><strong>Q: Do pivot hinges require a floor cut-out?</strong></p>
  <p>A: Most floor-mounted pivot systems require a floor pocket — typically 3 to 4 inches deep — cut into the structural slab before the finish floor is applied. This pocket houses the bottom pivot assembly and anchor fasteners. In new construction, floor pockets are straightforward to incorporate into the slab layout. Retrofit installations require cutting into existing flooring and verifying that structural concrete of adequate thickness is available at the required depth, which can be costly and complex, particularly in post-tensioned slabs. Surface-mounted floor plate alternatives eliminate the floor pocket but result in a more visible floor plate and may raise the pivot point slightly above floor level.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <p><strong>Q: Are pivot hinges fire-rated?</strong></p>
  <p>A: Some pivot hinge systems are UL-listed for use on fire-rated door assemblies. However, the range of listed pivot assemblies is substantially narrower than for butt hinges, and specific fire-rating durations (20-minute through 90-minute) vary by manufacturer and product line. When specifying pivot hinges for a fire-rated opening, confirm that both the pivot hardware and the complete door assembly — including frame, door, closing device, seals, and latching hardware — are covered by the same UL listing. Consult with the pivot hinge manufacturer early in the design process to obtain current UL listing data for the required fire-rating duration.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <p><strong>Q: Can pivot hinges meet ADA accessibility requirements?</strong></p>
  <p>A: Pivot hinges themselves are passive hardware and do not inherently create ADA compliance issues, but several parameters must be verified. When a floor-spring closer is integrated, the spring tension must produce an opening force of 5 lbf or less at the leading edge of the door for interior accessible-route doors. The offset of an offset pivot hinge can slightly reduce the effective clear opening width — verify that 32 inches of clear width is maintained with the door at 90 degrees. If a hydraulic closing mechanism is included, verify that the door closes from 90 degrees to 12 degrees in no less than 5 seconds. Consult ADA Standards for Accessible Design Section 404 and ICC A117.1 for complete requirements applicable to your installation.</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
  <p><strong>Q: What applications are pivot hinges best suited for?</strong></p>
  <p>A: Pivot hinges are best suited for heavy entrance doors in commercial lobbies, high-end retail storefronts, hotel main entries, restaurant kitchen pass-through doors (center pivot), frameless all-glass storefront doors, and monumental architectural feature doors in government, cultural, and institutional buildings. They are the standard choice when door weight exceeds the practical capacity of butt hinges (generally 200 lbs or more per leaf) or when a visually minimal hardware profile is a design priority. Restaurant kitchen pass-through doors particularly benefit from the bi-directional swing capability that center pivot systems provide, allowing servers and kitchen staff to pass through in both directions without stopping to pull or push on the correct side.</p>
